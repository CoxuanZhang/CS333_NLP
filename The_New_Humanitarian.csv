War in Iraq sidelines global poverty and AIDS,"The World Bank has expressed concern that terrorism and the war in Iraq are diverting attention from efforts to tackle poverty and HIV/AIDS in developing countries. Addressing the recent African Development Forum in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Bank president James Wolfensohn said: ""Indeed, the single statistic that tells it all is that in this last year, the world spent US $900 billion on military expenditure and only between $50 and $60 billion on development."" He noted that the biggest threat to governance in Africa was HIV/AIDS, and warned that the world might not enjoy peace and stability unless it addressed the continent's poverty. Research shows that per capita growth in half the countries of sub-Saharan Africa is falling by 0.5 to 1.2 percent each year as a direct result of HIV/AIDS."
Military attaches call for help for destitute war veterans,"Ethiopia has been urged to increase aid to its elderly war veteranswho fought to end the Italian occupation in the 1930s. Military officials from 13 embassies in the capital, Addis Ababa, said many of the surviving 110,000 veterans of the war against the forces of late Italian president Benito Mussolini were ""destitute, ill and homeless"". The Military Attaché Association of Addis Ababa said that greater support must be given to thousands of patriots who risked and lost their lives in the bloody struggle. In a statement released on Wednesday, the association paid tribute to these men and women, saying they had fought for Ethiopia’s prized ""independence and honour"" that is celebrated across Africa. ""As fellow military officers from all over the world,"" the organisation said, ""we understand and appreciate the past sacrifices of the Ethiopian patriots. We believe it is important to provide assistance to improve the quality of life of the remaining patriots."" The association comprises military attaches from China, Côte d’Ivoire, France, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, Sudan, the UK, the US and Zimbabwe. They donated US $2,000 to provide the veterans with desperately needed food and clothing, prior to the onset of cold weather. The struggle against Mussolini is an integral part of Ethiopian history. The Italian occupation had prompted the late emperor, Haile Selassie, to flee and appeal for help at the League of Nations. The plea fell on deaf ears, but following the outbreak of World War II, the Ethiopian patriots and British troops eventually expelled the occupying force. Historian Richard Pankhurst told IRIN that the patriots fought a relentless war against the Italian forces to expel them from the country despite a widespread terror campaign mounted by the latter. Ethiopians faced mustard-gas attacks and a brutal onslaught by one of Italy’s most ruthless colonial generals, Rodolfo Graziani, during the six-year occupation, Pankhurst said. One of the bloodiest episodes followed an attempt to assassinate Graziani in February 1937, which sparked a vicious crackdown in which thousands were killed. Currently the Association of Ethiopian Patriots tries to publicise the veterans’ plight and helps to look after them. But, say the military attaches, more support is needed for the men and women who waged war against the occupation, which ended in 1941. Ethiopia’s struggle against colonialism ensured that Addis Ababa was chosen as the seat for the Organisation of African Unity - now replaced by the African Union - which was founded to foster independence and economic recovery on the continent."
UNHCR to close more camps in Pakistan,"The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is planning to close some of the camps housing Afghan refugees in parts of Pakistan's two western provinces of Balochistan and North West Frontier Province (NWFP), which border Afghanistan. ""The exact schedule has yet to be finalised. However, the [refugee] camps located in the western tribal region along NWFP and also those in Chagai district of Balochistan would be closed or consolidated in the next two months,"" Jack Redden, a UNHCR spokesman, told IRIN in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. At present, the UN refugee agency administers about 130 refugee camps, home to over a million Afghans across the South Asian nation. The refugees are provided with free education, medical care, water and sanitation at the camps. ""The Afghans will be given the option of relocating to other camps [within Pakistan] or voluntary repatriation back to Afghanistan availing UNHCR's assistance package,"" Redden said. In a similar move in 2004, the agency closed 12 new camps in NWFP and Balochistan set to temporarily house refugees fleeing the war that unseated the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan in late 2001. More than 39,000 out of 65,000 refugees listed in new camps in NWFP returned, while 43,000 from a total of 127,000 Afghans repatriated from Balochistan, under the additional voluntary repatriation assistance package of the UNHCR, while the rest moved to old camps. The UN refugee agency's voluntary repatriation programme from Pakistan operates under a special tripartite agreement between UNHCR and the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan and will run until March 2006. Nearly 2.3 million Afghans have returned from Pakistan since 2002 under UNHCR's voluntary repatriation assistance programme. The agency estimated a further 400,000 would return this year, the agency spokesman said. Meanwhile, a UNHCR-sponsored Afghan Return Commission Working Group (RCWG) delegation is currently visiting Pakistan to update the refugee community about the situation in their homeland and removing other concerns they might have about returning. The nine-member RCWG team, composed of delegates from five northern provinces of Afghanistan; Balkh, Sar-I-Pul, Jowzjan, Samangan and Faryab, has been visiting refugees across all four provinces of Pakistan

China donates US $4 million equipment,"The People's Republic of China has donated equipment worth US $4 million to the Central African Republic (CAR), state-owned Radio Centrafrique reported on Tuesday. Chinese Ambassador El Si Ji made the donation, comprising 20,000 corrugated iron sheets, 110 computers, 3,000 bicycles and 60 mt of office furniture, on behalf of his government during a ceremony on Monday in the capital, Bangui. The iron sheets will be used to rebuild military barracks while the CAR transitional government will use the computers, bicycles and office furniture during general elections planned for early 2005. ""China is following closely the development of the transition in CAR and rejoices that encouraging results are being obtained,"" El Si Ji, was quoted as saying. He added that China would continue to support CAR during its transition. The minister for international cooperation, Daniel Nditifei-Boissembe, received the donation on behalf of the CAR government. ""CAR has experienced hardships and it will remain grateful to China for its constant material and financial assistance,"" he said. China was the first country to assist CAR following a 15 March 2003 coup by former armed forces chief of staff, Francois Bozize, who overthrew President Ange-Felix Patasse after a six-month rebellion. On 11 March 2004, China granted the CAR a $ 2-million interest-free loan to help the government pay salary arrears owed to civil servants

British millions pledged for AIDS battle,"Britain's international development secretary Hilary Benn has announced funding of close to US $214 million over the next four years to tackle HIV/AIDS around the world. The new funding will also aim to improve sexual and reproductive health for women and young people in developing countries. The UK's Press Association quoted Benn as saying: ""Sexual and reproductive health and AIDS are inextricably linked. By taking on one, we know we are also helping to tackle the other. Far too many poor women in developing countries live with painful, disabling, and hidden injuries or illness because they are denied their rights to sexual and reproductive health."" Approximately $66 million of the funds go to UNAIDS to pay for its role in leading the global HIV/AIDS effort and coordinating international donations, while some $147 million has been allocated to the UN Population Fund over four years."
Interview with Turkish Ambassador to Iraq,"Turkey is determined to improve relations with and continue humanitarian work in neighbouring Iraq, despite the rejection last year of Turkish troop deployment by the US-appointed Iraqi Governing Council. In an interview with IRIN, Turkey's Ambassador to Iraq, Osman Paksüt, said that although his country had offered humanitarian assistance it was becoming increasingly difficult to deliver it because of the poor security situation. He also highlighted the difficulties of conducting official business in the absence of well-established administrative structures on the Iraqi side. QUESTION: What sorts of humanitarian activities are you carrying out in Iraq? ANSWER: The security situation is hampering our humanitarian activities. Travelling around is dangerous for anyone. For example, you saw the Bulgarian president was shot at the other day as his convoy was travelling somewhere around Najaf [holy city in southern Iraq]. Poor security even lead to the cancellation of a trade fare due to be held in Baghdad. Now it has been switched to Turkey. Unless the situation improves, reconstruction work and humanitarian work cannot go forward. Q: What are the immediate tasks you will carry out in Iraq? A: Last year, we allocated US $5 million for humanitarian work. We wanted to build two hospitals. We started building one hospital in Baghdad, but we couldn't proceed as planned because of [poor] security. The second one, we wanted to build in Kirkuk. It was not approved by the administrators there. So we are a little bit frustrated with the way our assistance offer was met. But we sent humanitarian supplies to northern Iraq and to Baghdad. We also hope to do irrigation and potable water projects in Mosul in the future. Q: What sort of humanitarian role do you expect to play in Iraq? A: We re-allocated $50 million this year to be spent on health infrastructure and education. We will help universities here and send students on exchange programmes to universities in Turkey. We want to build hospitals in agreement with local authorities. But there still is confusion about who will be in charge after 30 June [when sovereignty is to be handed over to Iraqis]. We don't know who will give the approval to build a school or a hospital. It's no fault on our part, but we have to wait to see what the administrative infrastructure will be here. Basically, that's what prevents us from doing assistance and reconstruction at the moment. Security is also a problem, but the [current] loose governing structure is worse. People are appointed to various offices, but then they're removed and replaced. This makes it difficult for us. We don't know if the Transitional Administrative Law, or TAL [approved by US administrators and appointed government leaders on 15 November] will be implemented. The majority of Iraqis do not embrace it. In fact, we understand [UN and Iraq] representatives are negotiating to pass a United Nations Security Council resolution to adjust parts of the transitional law. They say there will be a caretaker government, but what will the caretaker government take care of? There's no point in rushing things on the ground, unless there's a dire humanitarian emergency [arising] from fighting [Coalition forces are currently battling insurgents in Fallujah and Najaf] or from an epidemic. We must plan more carefully and prepare projects with the right people and agencies. Q: What particular skills or expertise do you bring to the humanitarian effort? A: We have sent several dozens of Iraqi patients to Turkish hospitals - children wounded during the war and some chronically ill people. In one case, we sent 12 people by plane to Turkey who came back to Iraq after treatment. After the terrorist bombings in Arbil earlier this year we treated more than 40 people for burns and other wounds. Some of them are still in Turkey. Also, take the number of cancer incidents. The number is increasing, probably from depleted uranium. We don't have the World Health Organization here. It's a tragedy that the United Nations and humanitarian agencies can't work here. The number of cancer patients has doubled or tripled, but there's no reliable proof of what's causing their disease. Iraqis are saying they can treat them, but they probably don't have the capability or the expertise. Sometimes they reject the problem because they feel offended when we say we can help. Q: What will Turkey's top priority be in Iraq? A: We are able to help in many respects. We can improve the sanitary and water systems here. Construction [expertise] is more advanced in Turkey, so we offered to build a new road, for example, from a new [Turkey/Iraq] border gate to Mosul. Our project would include a border gate to the west of the current border gate and would pass through Talafar, a Shi'ite region in northern Iraq. This project was not agreed to on the Iraqi side. They said, just open the second gate and make the road go to Zakhou [a northern region between Mosul and the Turkish border]. From Khabur gate [the current Turkey/Iraq border crossing], our aim is to revitalise the economy of the Mosul region. They did not approach the idea warmly, however. Presently the road is controlled by the KDP [Kurdish Democratic Party]. The KDP are collecting taxes and fees. They say they can calculate what they owe to the central government and compensate them, but others aren't collecting the same kind of taxes. It is a source of income for the Kurdish authorities. I don't want to accuse them, but we couldn't agree on the road. It places an extra financial burden on Iraq if they don't accept our help, since it would cost $60 million to $90 million to build such a road. We could find financing for this project. It could be the World Bank or Turkish financing. There is also a project to build a railroad from Turkey south into Iraq, but it requires building the track. These are long-term projects. There should be a government to negotiate with, not just the Ministry of Planning, although the minister is very good. There is no prime minister, there is no five-year plan, there is no one-year plan, nothing. State structures are not existing, so that's a problem. Countries like Japan have had good success with smaller projects, so I shouldn't use that excuse for our problems in Iraq. But there needs to be the correct interlocutor. The system, the situation is unreliable. It's not the people, they are very reliable. All the ministers are very reliable. But they are new in their jobs and don't have the staff, the power, or the authority to give instructions. They don't have good communications. There is no banking. Q: How was the US-appointed Iraqi Governing Council's rejection of Turkish troops to help bolster security in the country viewed back home in Turkey? A: We felt relieved when it was rejected. We made a good-faith offer after receiving an invitation from the United States. We saw our troops would be welcome if they were not under the command of the Coalition forces. If it was a stabilising force, it would be welcome. But the Kurdish reaction was so strong, it was backed by others in the Governing Council. Q: There are some 12,000 Kurds from Turkey living in northern Iraq - what is their situation now and are they returning home? A: The Turkish Kurds are mainly people who moved to Iraq when the PKK [Kurdistan Worker's Party] and [Turkish] security forces conflict reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s. We realised the PKK's aim was to create a base where more militants were in their ranks. Once a refugee camp becomes more permanent, it is a way of life. So, the situation in the camp is that PKK elements in Iraq want the camp to stay as it is. But the security situation in Turkey is now safe. People can come back now. It won't be easy but we have to show them the way. We still must negotiate some details, however. Q: What assistance will you give these refugees? How will you integrate their return into Turkish society? A: There is an agreement between UNHCR [the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] Turkey and Iraq to close down this camp. But a lot of people don't want to go back. There are things the Turkish government will do and there are things UNHCR will do. The United States says it will also help, but now, as sovereignty comes to Iraq [scheduled for 30 June] there is a little bit of foot-dragging on the part of the United States on making guarantees for the safe and orderly implementation of this agreement. The problem is, in a few months they'll say they're out of this. The agreement didn't enter into force yet, but refugees would return to their villages. The Turkish government doesn't promise jobs or houses, but it would help. It will be the job of the governorates [in Turkey] to make sure this happens. Repatriation has to be orderly. It will take several months or a year. Some housing will be necessary, since houses may have been damaged before. If the refugees are going to rebuild, instead of mud houses, they should get more modern housing. Many in the camp married Iraqis. Some children don't know Turkish at all, and the families have not been home in more than a decade. So adaptation for them is quite a project. UNHCR requires help to bring the people back, and they need to be screened. If people are accused of terrorist activities, they have the right to find out if they are accused of any crimes. This process will be completed before they go back. With housing and other things, the World Bank can help, the European Union can help. Q: How are commercial relations between Turkey and Iraq, especially with regards to the oil pipeline leading to the Ceyhan terminal? A: The pipeline was sabotaged many times on the Iraq side. But as long as it is safe and operational on the Iraq side, crude oil will be pumped from the Iraq terminal. Oil production overall is not at 100 percent efficiency yet. In the short-term, [the southern city of] Basra will be the key, but in the north there are more oil fields in the Kirkuk area that have not been exploited. Some people say Iraq's reserves are still twice as much as the current known oil in Iraq, but it will take billions of dollars to explore. We also know there are natural gas fields in Mosul. Q: Are you involved with oil exploration in Iraq now? A: We can build other pipelines, so we see a huge potential for cooperation between Turkey and Iraq on this. But when we talk to the [US-appointed] Governing Council, they say they are temporary and cannot make a permanent decision because it's not their role to make such an important national decision. Technically, it's not possible to increase oil production overnight. The first thing Iraq needs is political stability. Oil pumping can come later. Q: Overall, what's your sense of Turkish relations with Iraq? A: Relationships between individuals are very good. The fact that the Turkish parliament declined to send troops was well received. We have much in common historically and culturally. But Kurdish nationalism was on the rise after the war. The fact that they had protection from [former President Saddam] Hussein gave them a lot of power. The idea now is to integrate them into a new regime, but they refuse to be integrated. They say they do not want to be an independent Kurdish state. They want to be part of Iraq, but they are like a detachable structure."
"India, Pakistan to send more troops","India and Pakistan are due to rapidly deploy some 1,700 soldiers to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), following Friday's resolution by the UN Security Council to increase the strength of its peacekeeping mission there, UN News reported on Tuesday. UN News said since the Council's unanimous adoption of the resolution, arrangements had been made for an emergency deployment of two battalions of some 850 soldiers each, from these two countries. India will also provide four attack helicopters. Quoting MONUC spokeswoman Patricia Tomé, UN News said the additional troops would bolster MONUC's operations to enable it to conduct a range of new tasks, such as protecting civilians and enforcing an arms embargo in the embattled eastern Congo. She was quoted as echoing the comments of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who welcomed the Council's action on Friday but warned that the new authorised troop level of 16,700 fell ""well below"" his recommended 23,900 peacekeepers and 507 civilian police. Besides the Indians and Pakistanis, the remaining troop increases are still under discussion, UN News reported. It added that India and Pakistan were also expected to provide one brigade - around 2,500 troops - each. UN News reported that MONUC's new authorised troop level, however, was insufficient to establish the ""civilian-military joint mission analysis cell"" recommended in Annan's report to the Council. In calling for the new structure, Annan said MONUC's effectiveness had ""suffered from the lack of established mechanisms for information management capable of providing detailed analysis to my Special Representative and the senior mission management"". On Friday, the Council also expanded MONUC's mandate to include protecting civilians ""under imminent threat of violence"", inspection of aircraft cargo and other traffic in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu and in the northeastern district of Ituri, in fulfilment of the arms embargo. MONUC would also observe and report on troop movements and the presence of foreign forces in military hotspots. The Council's resolution asked Annan to report to it by the end of February 2005 on MONUC's structure and strength ""with a view to their adjustment according to the progress made on the ground and the tasks remaining to be accomplished"". Tomé was quoted as saying the review would provide an opportunity to examine the success of the operation, which is being conducted across a huge span of territory."
NGO’s reaffirm commitment to Iraq,"NGOs working in Iraq have agreed on the need for stronger advocacy and the need to create safe space for humanitarian work, following a conference held in the Jordanian capital, Amman. ""We (NGOs) aim to provide independent and universal humanitarian and development assistance solely based on Iraqi people’s needs, rights and interests,"" Kasra Mofarah, executive coordinator of the NGO Coordination Committee for Iraq (NCCI) said. The conference and two-day workshop, which ended on Thursday, was convened to look at how successful NGO work in Iraq has been over the past two years given the poor security situation in the country. ""We are now working on a plan to regain humanitarian space,"" he added. Some 70 NGOs and 44 representatives from UN agencies and donors took part in the event. Aid workers have been facing increasing threats in the country and reconstruction work has been severely hampered by bombings, shootings, kidnappings and constant threats. Many aid agencies have pulled out of the country and are providing what assistance they can from neighbouring countries, including Jordan. Since September 2004, 15 NGO employees have been killed and 20 wounded by insurgents. A large number have also been detained by US-led coalition forces and by Iraqi authorities. According to Mofarah, the lack of humanitarian aid and reconstruction at a time when the country needs it most, has had a huge impact on ordinary Iraqis. ""There is less electricity, less food, poor health facilities, insecurity and less access to basic needs,"" said Mofarah. Participants voiced their commitment and confidence in the ability of NCCI to produce a work-plan to protect aid workers within two months, he added. The work-plan will include proposals to regain unrestricted access to affected communities without being targeted by either side in the conflict. ""We are independent, neutral and impartial aid workers, without any link to the political agenda and the line between the military and aid workers is blurred now,"" Mofarah stressed."
Activists push for women's rights in Iraq,"Salam Smeisim, an economist, wears a head scarf and long skirt; her boss, Narmin Othman, Minister of State for Women, wears a black trouser suit with no scarf. Their choice of dress might seem innocuous to the outsider, but clothing is a big symbol in a country where around 90 percent of women are covered head to toe in abayas (black gowns) or wear head scarves pinned around their chins. The two women share a passion for women's issues and want to get more women involved in politics. To help achieve this they are holding an all-female mini ""national assembly"" in the coming days to name 25 women to be advisers to Othman. Some 400 participants have been invited to the conference, which will recieve US $100,000 in funding from the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Iraqi leaders in August named a national assembly of 100 to serve as an advisory group to the country's interim cabinet. ""I am Islamic, but I also am an activist,"" Smeisim told IRIN. ""I don't see any contradiction between women's rights and Islam, but I'm fighting male attitudes here. Many men want to keep women from taking their place in the new Iraq,"" Smeisim said. But such activists are finding women to run for office and educating female voters to let them know they can vote the way they want to in the future. The new parliament, scheduled to open in January, is to be 25 percent women under rules set up by former US administrator Paul Bremer. Women currently make up 55 percent of the population, a result of the country's numerous wars which have killed a large number of men. Iraqi voters had no choice for 35 years, since former president Saddam Hussein's Baath Party was in charge, Smeisim said. Now, six of the more than 30 interim ministers are female, Othman told IRIN, adding that the country now has over 500 women's organisations. ""People were controlled under Saddam, but those who are older and well-educated remember their rights and know the meaning of equality and women's issues. Iraq's society might be a male-oriented society, but why not consider that a woman can be president or prime minister?"" she said. But the ongoing violence in Iraq makes attitudes slower to change, Amal al-Mamalachi, an adviser at the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works, told IRIN. Kidnappings and shootings in the streets keep women at home protecting their families, she said. Islamic conservatives have also encouraged women to cover up when they go outside, the adviser added. ""The are not afraid for themselves, but for their families."" One of the first government leaders to be assassinated last autumn was a woman, before assassinations of top officials became almost commonplace. American lawyer Fern Holland was killed last spring after speaking out on women's issues. Several women leaders have been threatened with death for speaking in favour of women's rights in Iraq in recent months, including Yanar Mohammed, head of the Organisation for Women's Federation in Iraq. But if women activists don't speak out now, they'll be fighting for years to get heard in government and elsewhere, the three women believe. ""This is the only opportunity for us to change,"" al-Mamalachi said. ""If we don't have a base for women to become important figures in government, later it will be hard to push our way in."" To get ready for the coming election season, women leaders first met outside political groups, such as the US-based International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. A group of women are outside the country learning how to be ""trainers"" who will come back to teach other women in Iraq what they have learned, Othman said. Finally, the women's ministry will start a TV and radio campaign to educate voters on their rights. ""We will make a list of women for the election who we think will fight for women's rights in this country,"" al-Mamalachi said."
"Junta leader vows to fight terrorism, confirms ties with Israel","The head of Mauritania’s new junta has vowed to continue the fight against desert terrorists, saying the country will honor international commitments entered by the ousted government. In what the state news agency called the first-ever press conference by a Mauritanian head of state, military leader Colonel Ely Ould Mohamed Vall also signalled that Mauritania would maintain its diplomatic ties to Israel - a relationship that since its inception in 1999 has been contentious in this Islamic republic straddling Arab and black Africa. “We have international commitments which we will respect entirely,” said Vall, who leads the military council that toppled 21-year president Maaouya Ould Taya in a bloodless coup in August. “We will do our best to block the proliferation of terrorism in our country,” Mauritania is one of several sub-Saharan African states where the United States is training soldiers in an effort to prevent international fundamentalist groups taking hold in the vast Sahel region. Calling terrorism a matter of national security, Vall said the phenomenon was contrary to Mauritanian values and custom. Shortly after seizing office, the military council in September announced a sweeping amnesty for political crimes, allowing exiles to return and freeing scores of prisoners, including coup plotters and some alleged Islamic extremists. But excluded from the general pardon were around 20 people alleged to have worked with the Algeria-based Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) - a movement linked to al-Qaeda. The GSPC claimed responsibility for an attack in June against a remote Mauritanian military barracks in which at least 15 soldiers were killed. Former leader Ould Taya touted a hard line against Islamic extremists, at times making sweeping arrests of people he accused of being Islamic radicals. But opposition leaders and international analysts say he exaggerated the extremist threat both to curry favour with the United States and as an excuse to stifle legitimate opponents. Some analysts say it was the ex-president’s harsh stance on Islamists that created an environment that encouraged extremists to strike out against the government. “The real impetus for terrorist activity was the extremely repressive nature of the former regime,” Olly Owen, Africa analyst at the London-based research group Global Insight, said. “If the political transition keeps up its momentum, you’ll likely see the terrorism problem die a natural death.” Junta leader Vall put his remarks about ties with Israel in the context of the Palestinian cause, in what Owen called a “canny” approach, given the sensitivity of the Arab-Palestinian issue among Mauritanians. Mauritania would always be among the nations supporting “the just cause of the Palestinian people,” Vall said, adding, “I assure you that this relationship [with Israel] is not to the detriment of the Palestinian people.” But some Mauritanian politicians continue to be dismayed at the Israel link. “Relations with Israel are against every religious conviction and against the will of the Mauritanian people,” said Ould Mansour, member of the Party of Democratic Convergence, which is considered pro-Islamist. Military leader sticks to transition vow, fails to commit on refugees Turning to domestic issues, Vall used the weekend press conference to reiterate the junta’s commitment to a return to elected civilian government, with presidential elections within two years. “The Military Council for Justice and Democracy is committed to its political reform plan, which will lead to a democratically elected president,” he said. Owen said that thus far the actions of the military council have been reassuring, but the road ahead is long and tough. “There will be difficult decisions down the line,” he said. “The essential thing is that they stick to the transition timetable.” Vall, referring to the some 20,000 black Mauritanian refugees exiled in Senegal for the past 16 years, said he would welcome them home, but fell short of saying he would organise a UN-sponsored return as called for by refugees and rights advocates. At least 30,000 Mauritanian refugees remain in Senegal and Mali of the 65,000 who fled ethnic violence in 1989-91. Last month a group of refugees and human rights activists appealed to the Mauritanian and Senegalese governments to organise a return under the auspices of the UN and international organisations. Abderrahmane Ngaide, who fled Mauritania in 1989 and has been a teacher and researcher in history at the University of Dakar for seven years, said he was disappointed that the military council appeared to be putting off the issue the refugees until after the transition. “They must assume their responsibilities,” he said. “But they are failing to do so in the case of the refugees.” He said the military council - many members of which were part of the Ould Taya regime - should come before the Mauritanian people, ask forgiveness for past wrongs, and move on. “We must not wait for the new government,” Ngaide said. “The time to deal with this is now.”"
UN-Afghan aid to Pakistan underway,"The UN and Afghan relief agencies are dispatching aid for survivors of the earthquake that hit northern Pakistan and India on 8 October. Officials at the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) said on Monday they were providing 15 mt of dried fruit to quake victims in the two South Asian nations. “We are preparing to dispatch 10 mt of dry fruit to the quake-affected areas in Pakistan, while we have already sent 5 mt of dry fruit to India yesterday,” ARCS Disaster Management head Javid Qanie said, adding they were waiting only on official permission from Pakistan to start deliveries. “Today or tomorrow, we will send the aid to Pakistan.” The Afghan government and the UN World Food Programme (WFP) agreed to send 65 trucks from WFP’s Afghanistan operation to assist in the transport of life-saving relief supplies to quake-hit areas in Pakistan, WFP said. “The trucks will transport food and non-food items urgently needed by the hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been without food and shelter since the quake struck,” said Charles Vincent, head of WFP in Afghanistan. The UN said more four million people had been affected by the quake and one million were in dire need of relief, while more than 2.5 million survivors needed to be re-housed. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said about 200,000 winterised tents were urgently needed. On Sunday, a joint convoy of more than 60 trucks from the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and WFP, carrying 1,500 tents, 20,000 blankets, 50,000 plastic sheets and 10,000 jerry cans, was set to leave Kabul for northern Pakistan, according to Nader Farhad from UNHCR Kabul. WFP Afghanistan has loaned WFP Pakistan 1,000 mt of wheat flour and provided 40 mt of dates donated by the government of Qatar. The dates were being sent from the WFP’s warehouse in Quetta to quake-affected areas, according to WFP. WFP will be setting up five UN base camps in the worst-hit locations in Pakistan to co-ordinate the relief operation. WFP has also flown in emergency response teams to Pakistan from Afghanistan and other parts of the world to help with the operation. WFP Afghanistan will provide assistance as needs evolve, Vincent said. Meanwhile, the Afghanistan government has provided four helicopters, along with 34 medical personnel and 4 mt of medicine. “Our medical personnel established a 50-bed mobile hospital, which has treated more than 800 wounded and conducted 70 major surgeries” Dr Ahmad Sha Shakuhmand from the health ministry said."
Taiwanese aid flows in after links with China cut,"Burkina Faso continues to reap the financial rewards of cutting diplomatic relations with China 10 years ago in order to establish links with Taiwan instead. The two countries signed an agreement on Thursday that provides for Taiwan to grant the West African country nearly US$14 million for water supply, irrigation and rural development projects over the next three years. Most of the money will be used to sink 1,000 boreholes to provide clean drinking water in villages and build 25 reservoirs to improve irrigation in rural areas. The remainder will be used to improve the roads in five provincial towns. Burkina Faso broke off diplomatic relations with China in 1994 and established formal ties with Taiwan instead. Since then it has received a steady flow of aid from the island state, which China regards as a renegade province of its own territory. The latest $14 million aid agreement on Thursday represents the first tranche of a $32.5 million Taiwanese aid package agreed last year to cover the period 2004-2006."
Registration for elections completed successfully in Pakistan,"Efforts to register hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees living in Pakistan to vote in the upcoming presidential elections finished on Monday with a high level of participation. ""We are extremely pleased and we consider the registration process a success,"" Darren Boisvert, a media officer for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), told IRIN on Tuesday from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. Although the process had ended, registration stations would remain open on Tuesday for supervised public viewing of the registration lists. According to the IOM, with an estimated 740,000 Afghans registered to participate in the presidential polls, the four-day Afghan Out-of-Country-Registration and Voting (OCRV) exercise has been the largest out-of-country voting operation for refugees ever held in such a short period of time, according to the IOM. Registration in some areas of the country was not possible due to the limited time available. An estimated 27 percent of the registered voters were women, a figure the IOM did not consider satisfactory. ""With only a very short period of time for mobilising women to register and vote, we could not have expected a higher turnout such as that in Afghanistan where the campaign lasted several months,"" Peter Erben, Director of the IOM's OCVR programme, said. The OCRV success was a result of an intensive awareness raising campaign launched by the IOM involving media, NGOs and Afghan communities in the Pakistani western province of Balochistan, North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Islamabad. ""We put out a lot of radio advertisements in Pashto and Dari, and mobilised into the communities to explain the registration process,"" Boisvert said. The IOM was entrusted with the task of conducting the ""out-of-country"" Afghan presidential election on behalf of the Afghan Joint Electoral Management Body (JEMB) and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). To carry out the OCRV exercise, the UN agency established 1,650 registration stations in and around some 300 locations in Pakistan, training and equipping some 20,000 staff in Iran and Pakistan. The IOM didn't conduct any Afghan refugee registration process in Iran, since the Iranian authorities did an early registration of Afghans living in the country in 2003. On 9 October, the first presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan and those Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan, expected to be 10 percent of the total electorate, will have the opportunity to vote within the country they are now living in. Some one million Afghan refugees in those countries are expected to vote. In Pakistan, polling stations will open between 7 am and 4 pm. Afghans will have to cast their votes at the same station where they registered and show their registration receipts. ""We are using that to eliminate any fraud, and [this] will help us to verify that the one who was registered is the same person who is voting,"" the IOM official said. In addition, Boisvert said that the registration process was held with no serious security incidents and highlighted the cooperation they received from the Pakistani government. ""No one was injured, no one was hurt and obviously that is a level of success,"" he said."
More Central African refugees arrive in Chad as families flee village raids,"At least 400 people – mostly women and children – have fled into southern Chad from the Central African Republic (CAR) in the past several days, after armed men raided their village, a UN official said on Thursday. Refugees told officials of the UN refugee agency, (UNHCR), and the Chadian government that on 18 July men armed with rifles entered their village of Kadjama, about two kilometres from the border in northern CAR, and broke into houses stealing food and clothing. The new influx comes just as UNHCR is completing an operation to relocate thousands of Central African refugees living in makeshift shelters in Chadian villages since fleeing conflict in CAR in June. Earlier this week local authorities in southern Chad informed UNHCR’s office in Gore, some 500 km south of the capital N’djamena and close to the CAR border, that new refugees were arriving. George Menze, head of UNHCR in Gore, told IRIN that his office had verified some of those reports after conducting a joint mission with Chadian officials to the border region on Wednesday. UNHCR will continue investigations to determine the exact number and location of the refugees, he said. Those refugees already located will be transferred as soon as possible to the Amboko camp near Gore, which already houses over 15,000 refugees most of whom fled from political violence in CAR years ago, Menze said. But heavy rains that can make roads impassable for days at a time are hampering the transfer operation, UNHCR’s Marie-Christine Boccoum told IRIN from N’djamena. Thousands of Central Africans fled to Chad in June to escape fighting between government forces and unidentified armed groups, according to UNHCR. They spent weeks living in or near Chadian villages near the border. UNHCR received special permission from the government to transfer the refugees to an existing camp at Amboko, as they were worried that the rains would eventually cut them off from humanitarian assistance. Many of the refugees were surviving on little more than wild roots and fruits. Initially UNHCR estimated that 10,000 refugees were scattered through 17 villages along the border region. To date UNHCR has transferred 3,600 Central African refugees to Amboko, Boccoum said. Another UNHCR official told IRIN some of the refugees have opted not to go to the camp, preferring instead to stay near the border. The refugee arrivals of the past two months join about 30,000 Central Africans who fled fighting in CAR in 2002 living in Amboko and a second camp, Yaroungou, also in southern Chad."
"BBC ""Calling Iraq"" programme well received","Iraqis have responded positively to the ""Calling Iraq"" radio project, produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Service Trust (WST), as an honest programme which raised social issues, one year after its programmes started to report on Iraqi needs. ""I think overall we have achieved what we planed to do originally. It was to provide educational information and to reflect the points of view of the people living in Iraq,"" Tim Williams, project director with the BBC, told IRIN from London. The WST launched a series of programmes in April 2003 through the BBC's Arabic Service and focused on the lack of security and health issues that Iraqi people were facing during the recent US war to oust Saddam Hussein. ""They were specifically their issues, their own voices, and what the Iraqi community itself is doing for the country, not only the work of the international community,"" Williams asserted. He explained that a local group of six people were rapidly trained in Baghdad to report for ""Calling Iraq"", which was transmitted from BBC studios in London. ""It was an Iraqi programme for Iraqis. That seems to be what the audience appreciated the most,"" Williams said. ""We were trying to come up with solutions to everyday practical problems and providing them with sources of information where they could go and find people who could help them,"" he added. However, according to a BBC evaluation report, listeners said the length of the five-minute programmes, broadcast five times a week twice a day, was too short. Many interviewees said the country was lacking an effective police force as most policemen were removed from their post because they were part of the Ba'ath party. ""The Americans were not felt to be able to hold the peace, and were often perceived as part of the threat to personal safety,"" the report said. In addition, respondents also expressed their concerns about the economy and national stability. ""There was dismay that many utilities were still under threat, such as electricity, and a related sense that there had not been sufficient planning and forethought given to what a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq would be like,"" the survey said. Williams expressed his satisfaction and said that the findings were helping them to come up with new ideas on fresh new projects for the Iraqi people. He added that the reporters also deserved more credit. ""The audience research doesn't reflect the dedication of the local team, who worked under very difficult circumstances. They were all threatened in their work but they still managed to get the reports and do a very good job,"" he stressed."
Women's groups under threat in the new Iraq,"Threats against women's rights groups in Iraq appear to be on the rise, with the environment becoming increasingly unsafe over the past weeks, activists say. According to American-educated women working at the Women for Women humanitarian agency, the mood against them is threatening to turn ugly. Threats and poor security kept half the workers at home for two days in the past week, the agency's Manal Omar told IRIN in Baghdad. The other half were evacuated to Amman, Jordan, she said. Women for Women was started following the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war by an Iraqi woman exiled in the United States who wanted to help women in post-conflict zones. It has recently opened other centres in the country. Other women's organisations have also been targeted, National NGO Support Working Group representative Anissa Badaoui told IRIN in Baghdad. Earlier this year women's rights activist Yanar Mohammed received death threats after she defended women's rights on Iraqi television. ""Stop speaking out for women's rights, or we will kill you,"" read the email sent to the activist, who founded the Organisation of Women's Freedom, in Iraq, after her media appearance. The email threat was the first of two and was signed by the Army of Sahaba, a shadowy Pakistani group that Mohammed believes follows conservative Wahabi Islam and has connections to the al-Qaeda terrorist network. ""They said, because of my psychologically disturbed ideas, they would have to kill me and crucify me,"" Mohammed told IRIN in Baghdad, ""It sounded to me like a serious warning."" In response, Mohammed and her colleagues hid in her simple, downtown office or at home for a week, wearing bullet-proof vests and canceling all appearances. But then she got angry. ""I was in a state of shock. I'm a woman activist and all of a sudden, I'm a target,"" Mohammed said. ""Women are oppressed, and they're still being oppressed."" Prior to appearing on television, Mohammed had also given lectures against a conservative Islamic code that many say discriminates against women. The code, based on Islamic Shariah law, was approved by the interim Iraqi Governing Council in December but has since been overturned by the US authorities. Mohammed continues to receive threats, but she says she remains committed to promoting women's rights under the new constitution. The constitution will make Islam one source of law, and this could mean that anything contradicting religious codes may not be allowed, Mohammed worries. For example, Islam allows men to marry many women and does not require a minimum marriage age. Both issues should be addressed by the new constitution, she said. ""After the war, groups from Iran and Saudi Arabia have funding to come in and teach these ideas - that women's rights are less than men, that they can be harassed on the street,"" the women's activist said. ""I'm living with fear every day, but I cannot wear a bullet-proof vest anymore."" There are also suggestions that American lawyer Fern Holland may have been killed because of her work with women's groups and her efforts to promote women's rights in the new Iraqi interim constitution. Holland died on 9 March when a car she was travelling in was shot at, allegedly by Iraqi police, on the road outside Hilla, about 100 miles south of Baghdad. Officials have not said directly that Holland was killed because of her work with women, but they say they are investigating the possibility. Holland had been working on women's issues in the region, and had just opened a women's centre, an open community building with Internet access and other community-oriented plans. ""She was visiting a women's centre the day she was killed and was well-known in the community,"" Dan Senor, a spokesman for the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). ""We have to let the process play out, because the conclusion that targeting of women is now happening has enormous implications. We don't want to say that unless it's valid."" Other high-profile women have also been targeted in the months since the US-led war on Iraq. Akila al-Hashimi, an Iraqi Governing Council member, was gunned down several months ago by unknown assailants, the only temporary government member to be killed so far. Some say she was killed because she was a woman, while others say she was seen as a collaborator with the former regime. Minister of Public Works Nasreen Barwari, another prominent Iraqi woman, also has received threats but so far has not been targeted."
US helps to revive economy of zone once occupied by Israel,"The United States has funded a series of projects to help revive the crippled economy of southern Lebanon following the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces five years ago. The projects, launched by the US NGO Mercy Corps in 2002, aim to revive farming and tourism in the southern provinces of Hasbaya and Marjayoun and equip young people there with IT skills. The two provinces, situated in the foot-hills of 3,000-metre-high Mount Hermon, were occupied by Israeli forces from 1978 until 2000. They became a battlefield between the Israeli army and the Shi'ite fighters of Hizbollah (Party of God) and an estimated 175,000 people fled the region in search of safety. Few have returned since the Israeli withdrawal, partly because of a lack of jobs in the area. Many of the region’s farms have been abandoned and residents who stayed put during the Israeli occupation can no longer commute over the border to work in Israeli factories. Other jobs linked to the presence of Israeli forces in southern Lebanon have also disappeared. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates unemployment in southern Lebanon at 20 to 20 percent. “The area suffered greatly during the war,” said Andy Dwonch, the head of Mercy Corps in Lebanon. “Lands were deserted and people could not come and visit. After the war there was hardly any work.” The Mercy Corps projects, which are now drawing to a close, were funded by a US $12.5 million dollar grant from USAID. One initiative was a forage project, which has helped 250 farmers in southern Lebanon to produce more cattle fodder through the supply of improved machinery and technology. Another project has helped a group of 22 farmers to produce and market organic fruit and vegetables. The group, which turns some of its produce into jam and pastes, now has its sales outlet in Beirut. It has even started to ship its products abroad. ""Last month we exported the first US $5,000 worth of goods to the United Arab Emirates,"" said Mercy Corps agricultural expert Mohamed Jameel. There has also been a drive to promote tourism. In the hills above the town of Khiyam, Mercy Corps are building a hotel with 18 bungalows for guests and a conference hall that overlooks the plains of Israel. Nearby, a British-built World War II bunker has been restored and converted into a museum and 380 hectares of woodland frequented by migratory birds have been turned into a nature reserve. In the town of Hasbaya, a holy city for Lebanon's Druze community, several archeological sites and buildings have been restored. A publicity campaign to lure Lebanese tourists back to the south will be launched in the spring."
Repatriation operation to continue from Pakistan - UNHCR,"The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will continue operating its voluntary repatriation assistance programme for Afghan refugees from Pakistan, as the agency announced a suspension of operations from Iran via Herat following the attack on the UN offices in the western Afghan city of Herat on Sunday. ""The UNHCR operation is continuing from Pakistan. There is no change in the operation here. Obviously the situation though is in the state of flux at the moment and our main concern is to ensure that everybody is safe in Herat,"" Jack Redden, a spokesman for UNHCR Pakistan, told IRIN in the capital, Islamabad, on Monday. The buildings of the UNHCR and the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) were attacked by demonstrators protesting against the sacking by Afghan President Hamid Karzai of Ismael Khan, the governor of the western Afghan province of Herat. ""The trouble is in the west, while mostly the people [Afghan refugees] are moving to eastern parts of Afghanistan from Pakistan,"" Redden said. Meanwhile, the UNHCR announced on Monday that it will end its assistance on 15 September to four ""new"" refugee camps in Balochistan located in the Chaman area of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan. The refuge agency had stopped all its activities in the nine ""new"" camps in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) on 31 August and two similar camps in Balochistan province on 5 September, but announced an extension for four camps offering the residents relocation to another camp in Balochistan at Mohammed Kheil. According to the UN refugee agency, no refugee in the four camps on the border at Chaman had accepted the offer to relocate to an alternative camp. Many Afghans in the Chaman camps said that, rather than relocate to a camp where basic services are available, they would prefer to stay without the UNHCR assistance near the border town where it is easy to find daily labouring jobs, the UNHCR press statement said. The UNHCR had announced earlier this year that the agency would end all assistance to ""new"" camps, established near the Pakistan-Afghan border to shelter those fleeing the conflict of late 2001 in Afghanistan. Some 82,000 out of a total of 190,000 Afghans availed themselves of the UNHCR special package for repatriation from ""new"" camps. However, the agency will continue to provide water, sanitation, education and medical services in nearly 200 ""old"" camps throughout Pakistan. The UNHCR statement said that it was difficult and expensive to provide services to the Chaman camps, which were located on a barren strip along the border with Afghanistan where water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. There was also increasing concern about security because of the long porous border, the statement said. The UNHCR's regular repatriation assistance package is available until March 2006 to all Afghans wishing to return from Pakistan. The UN refugee agency has assisted some 2.25 million Afghans repatriating to their homeland, including some 350,000 so far this year."
UNHCR suspends Afghan repatriation from Pakistan,"The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced on Monday the suspension of the voluntary repatriation assistance programme for Afghans living in Pakistan. The programme is being suspended from 27 December and will resume by 1 March next year. ""In the past two years, we suspended it just during February, so it's for two months this time. It's [only] a small number [of refugees] repatriating at this time of the year, so it would not have much impact... It has been suspended from Pakistan only and not from Iran,"" Jack Redden, a UNHCR spokesman told IRIN in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. Only 126 individuals went through UNHCR repatriation facilities on Sunday, raising the total since the start of the season in March this year to 382,781 Afghans, according to a UNHCR press statement. Since the start of voluntary repatriation assistance programme in 2002, UNHCR has assisted some 2,290,950 Afghans to repatriate from Afghanistan. A further 779,000 Afghans have returned to Afghanistan from Iran with UNHCR assistance while another 321,000 repatriated on their own. ""Looking at the small number of returnees, it was decided to keep the programme closed, and was better to spend the time in training the staff. Also, early this year, they [staff] would be assisting in some of the preparations for a proposed government census of all the Afghans living in Pakistan,"" Redden said. Under the repatriation programme, the refugee agency offers Afghans wishing to return to their homeland a package of travel assistance, varying from $8 to $30 per person, depending on the distance travelled, and a cash payment of $12 per person to help them get re-established in Afghanistan, the press statement said. All the benefits are paid on arrival in Afghanistan, the statement added. All those repatriating who are over the age of six are required to go through an iris verification test to avail themselves of the assistance, to ensure that no one receives the return help more than once. ""Younger people cannot be tested in this way, so various verification checks are made by UNHCR staff. In general, they are interviewed to make sure that children really are from that family and that they are legitimate returnees. And so on that they know the place they are going to and where they came from,"" Redden said. The UNHCR estimates that about a million Afghans are still living in refugee camps in Pakistan, some of them dating back 25 years, while a substantial number of Afghans live in urban settlements in Pakistani cities. According to UNHCR, this is the largest voluntary assisted return programme in the 53-year history of the UN agency, with a total of more than three million people who have been helped to return to Afghanistan over the last three years. The UN refugee agency operates the voluntary repatriation assistance programme for Afghans under a tripartite agreement between UNHCR and the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The programme will resume on 1 March 2005, marking the launch of the final year of the programme, which runs until March 2006."
NGOs call for emergency funds and transparency for Iraq,"NGOs working in Iraq have called on donors to establish emergency funds that can be disbursed quickly, to provide support for aid workers in dangerous conditions. This in addition to more transparency and accountability with regards to the trust fund. The statement was issued by the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq (NCCI) on Tuesday as donors involved in the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, (IRFFI) met at the Dead Sea resort in Jordan on 18-19 July to review progress of reconstruction in Iraq. NGOs were not invited to the meeting. “The idea was for us to participate and point out our concerns as well as the realities on the ground and that’s what we have done through this statement,” Kasra Mofarah, NCCI executive coordinator, said. NGOs, who have attended the previous three Iraq donor meetings in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Japan, say they were surprised that they were not directly involved this time. “We still don’t know why they didn’t invite us to the conference. The added value is here and the ideas are here,” Mofarah said. The need for contingency funding should be a priority, he added. “The conflict is so sporadic in Iraq that by the time we wait for funds to be released, the situation for displaced people for example, or people in need, has changed and we are unable to help them during the crucial time,” explained Mofarah. The IRFFI meeting was hosted by the Jordanian government and jointly chaired by Canada and Iraq, bringing together representatives from over 70 countries and international organisations, including the United Nations Development Group (UNDG), the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). They oversee a facility established at the 2003 Madrid conference to better coordinate donor contributions. It consists of two trust funds, separately administered by the WB and the UN in close consultation with the Iraqi authorities and donors. International donors have only committed a total of US $1 billion to the two trust funds. A total of $32 billion was pledged at the Madrid conference, with the biggest contribution of $ 18.4 billion from the USA. A joint UN/World Bank task force then estimated Iraq’s reconstruction needs at $36 billion in the period up to 2007. Of that total, $600 million went to the UN trust fund and the remainder to the WB. The $400 million held in the WB trust fund has been allocated to nine reconstruction projects, including school rebuilding and health care facilities. At the Dead Sea conference the Iraqi government set out strategic priorities for reconstruction and development with the two areas of governance and basic human needs requiring urgent attention. “On the one hand, we urgently need emergency/humanitarian interventions to provide basic services such as water, electricity, hospitals and schools,” Iraqi minister of planning and development cooperation, Barham Salih, said at the conference. “On the other hand, we need to start implementing reforms, building institutions and developing the capacities that will support a vibrant market-oriented economy. These interventions need to start immediately but will yield benefits in the medium-term and for generations to come.”"
Palestinians from Iraq seek shelter in Syria,"A group of Palestinian refugees from Iraq have been allowed into Syria, settling in shelters at a UN refugee camp after having been stranded on the border for over a month, the UNHCR in Damascus confirmed on Sunday. The group of 19 refugees, which include children and elderly people, had been stuck at the al-Waleed border post since October 4. Seeking refuge in Syria from deteriorating security conditions in Iraq, they had initially been denied entry due to their lack of personal documentation, such as passports. While in limbo on the border, however, the refugees had been provided by the UNHCR with tents, blankets and food, and were visited twice by a doctor. On 9 November, after negotiations between the UNHCR and the Syrian Interior Ministry, the group was finally allowed into the country and taken to the Al-Hol refugee camp in Syria’s northeastern province of Hassake. ""The Syrian government allowed the UNHCR to take the Palestinians to the al-Hol camp, where they have been provided with facilities,"" said Abdel-hamid el Ouali, UNHCR representative in Damascus. ""Some of them have even got their children into school."" The al-Hol camp, situated close to the border, was established by the UNHCR in 1991 in the wake of the first Gulf War. While the camp has continued to provide temporary shelter for incoming Iraqi refugees, it has remained largely empty, with the majority of Iraqis arriving in Syria quickly moving on to the capital, Damascus. Before the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in the spring of 2003, the number of Iraqis living in Syria was estimated at up to 100,000. Today, however, that figure is estimated at 500,000, the majority of whom live in the suburbs of Damascus in deteriorating socio-economic conditions. Abuses associated with child labour are common amongst the refugee community and a large number of Iraqi women have reportedly turned to prostitution to support their families. Making matters more difficult, Syrian immigration laws stipulate that resident Iraqis must travel out of the country every six months in order to renew their residence permits. Those who can’t travel, however, are forced to live clandestinely. Refugees International reported that 22,000 Iraqi refugees have registered in total for temporary protection with the UNHCR office in Damascus. There has been a steady rise in the number of Iraqi refugees crossing into Syria since September, following two major US-led offensives against so-called “insurgents” in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, which have included air strikes and as many as 3,500 US and Iraqi ground troops. The UNHCR estimates that a few thousand Iraqis are also living in precarious conditions in the areas around the central border town of Abu Kamal,lying on the Euphrates river. With the aim of helping those still stranded in Abu Kamal, the UN refugee agency has launched an initiative aimed at providing immediate help in the form of food aid, in cooperation with the Syrian Red Crescent Organisation and the Italian Red Cross, both of which have pledged to provide medical assistance."
Solution needed for displaced in Pakistan-administered Kashmir,"Pakistan's leading human rights body has expressed concern over the condition of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) living in camps located in Pakistani administered Kashmir. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has said in its annual report released on Tuesday that the conditions that IDPs face remain grim inside camps housing those displaced by the conflict with India over Kashmir over a fifteen year period. ""These camps, housing some 25,000 migrants, were set up on an emergency basis in [the] 90s, without any proper planning. Now they've turned to slums where there is an imminent threat of disease due to poor sanitation,"" Sadiq Dar,head of the Relief Commissionerate (RC) of the Pakistani- administered Kashmir government, told IRIN from Muzzaffarabad, 135 km north of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, on Wednesday. The RC has set up 15 camps in parts of Pakistani-administered Kashmir for IDPs. The relief body believes an equal number of displaced people were living with their relatives elsewhere inside Pakistan. A monthly subsistence allowance of 750 rupees (about US $13) is given to every migrant, according to Dar, ""Besides we've also made arrangements for schools and health care units inside camps being run by various NGOs."" Increased tension between India and Pakistan between 1998 and 2001 caused heavy displacement along the Line of Control (LoC) diving the disputed territory of Kashmir. The state relief body estimates that up to 250,000 people have been displaced to date. However, after the ceasefire in 2003 most of them have returned back to their villages, said Dar. ""Some 200 families are left, who are unable to move back due to land mines in their areas and they are staying at camps now,"" Dar added. An international charity, Islamic Relief, working in the area for over a decade to improve health care, water and sanitation systems, stressed the need to help the remaining IDPs to resettle permanently. ""A long conflict has caused huge damage to private property and social infrastructure in the area. Local communities have been suffering as they have lost their cattle, their entire livelihood, fields were mined prohibiting any agricultural activity,"" Muhammad Niyaz, programme officer at the country branch of Islamic Relief in Islamabad, told IRIN. Some international assistance has been forthcoming for the blighted region. Recently, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a US $57 million loan for a multi-sector rehabilitation and improvement project, aimed at improving the physical and social infrastructure of Pakistani-administered Kashmir."
Aid organisations hope for more investment in Iraq,"As Jordan prepared to host the World Economic Forum (WEF) this Friday, aid organisations said they hope the event will assist in the development of Iraq. “We hope that the forum will further speed the development process in Iraq and we hope that it will encourage the private sector to invest in the country, as the private sector is a major job creator and employer,” Faris Haddad from the World Bank Iraq office based in the Jordanian capital, Amman, told IRIN on Thursday. The Iraqi government is now planning medium-term projects. A critical element being considered is the humanitarian situation, where vulnerable groups’ needs should be urgently met, Haddad added. Many aid agencies and contractors have pulled out of Iraq because of insecurity hampering reconstruction efforts. Around US $32 billion has been pledged for the reconstruction of Iraq by some 37 countries. The funds will be channelled through the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) launched early in 2004 by the UN and the World Bank. The facility helps donor nations channel their resources and coordinate their support for reconstruction and development in Iraq. So far more than half a billion dollars of these funds have been approved for reconstruction projects. A series of round table discussions were held with key political and business figures in the week leading up to the forum where the issue of public-private partnerships was identified as a key factor in development. More than 1,300 participants will be attending this year’s two-day forum between 20-22 May, at the Dead Sea. The list of attendees includes key public figures as well as prominent private sector organisations and NGOs from the Middle East, Europe, Africa, the USA and Australia. This is the third consecutive year that the WEF is being held in Jordan, with this year’s theme being ‘Seizing the Moment.’ Participants will examine a number of themes including economic growth, peace and security, reform and the Middle East in the global economy as well as society and change. The WEF is an independent, international non-profit organisation that aims at establishing a world class corporate governance system. “We believe that economic progress without social development is not sustainable, while social development without economic progress is not feasible,” a WEF statement said."
Special report on Iranian refugees from Iraq.,"Dressed very smartly in a black suit and a pale pink shirt, Hamid (not his real name) started to tell the story of how he fled Iran in 1990 due to his political activities and lived in northern Iraq until 2002. As he talked he was interrupted by a mobile phone call. He quickly answered and got the caller to call back later. It's not the usual image of a refugee in desperate circumstances, but it's now common among Iranian refugees in the southeastern Turkish city of Van who say it's important to be contactable in case they receive news on resettlement in a third country, their ultimate dream. They also need to keep in touch with other refugees on issues affecting their community, including protection. Hamid was a member of an opposition party in neighbouring Iran and said he had to leave in fear of his life. The move to Turkey in 2002 meant a tough transition. ""I paid a smuggler US $1,000 to help me get across the border into Turkey with my wife and two children,"" he told IRIN in Van. He is one of 1,200 Iranians previously living in northern Iraq now in the ancient southeastern city, set some 1,700 metres above sea level with a centuries old citadel. Another 600 Iranians entered Turkey directly from Iran. The refugees moved to Turkey over a number of years from 1998, due to restrictions imposed by Baghdad, which meant that they were accepted as refugees but those residing in northern Iraq, during Saddam Hussein's rule, could not get exit permits to leave the country. Therefore, in search of access to resettlement, they travelled to Turkey. There are an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 Iranian refugees in Iraq. The Iranians from northern Iraq in Van are a distinct group because they transited a country of asylum en route to Turkey. Prior to the war, for many of these individuals, northern Iraq was generally a safe place of asylum. NEW AGREEMENT While there had been some dispute over their status, Ankara has since allowed this group of people the right to be moved to other ""satellite cities"", to be spread across a total of 16 central Anatolian cities, giving them the right to work. Under an agreement proposed in November 2003 and signed in April 2004, the 1,200 Iranian refugees from northern Iraq have already started moving to other Turkish cities to begin a new life with a third of the caseload already having left Van. They are issued vouchers by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) enabling them to receive free bus tickets to their allocated city. They also receive some financial assistance, depending on the size of the family, to help them get started and are granted residence, under law number 5683 for foreigners travelling and residing in Turkey, and must obtain work permits in compliance with the provisions of law number 4817. 
[Iraq] The city of Van is home to centuries old Citadel.
The city of Van is home to a centuries old Citadel
""I picked up my voucher from the UN yesterday. They gave me these documents,"" Hamid told IRIN in Van, as he waved some pieces of paper containing details of his family members and photos. ""Life is tough here, I haven't really been able to work and have only done the odd job,"" he explained, adding that his wife was volunteering at the Turkish Educational Volunteers Foundation (TEGV) which has allowed refugee children and refugee volunteer teachers to participate in the programme. ""I'm being moved to Cankiri [131 km from the capital, Ankara]. I really don't know what it's going to be like there and I don't even know where we are going to live, but I hope I can find work,"" he said, sighing hopelessly. Another Iranian refugee, formerly living in the Al-Tash camp in northern Iraq bordering Iran, was more optimistic about his move. The young man, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt, was clearly proud of his fluency in English and said he was looking forward to moving. ""I've been told I'm going to Kutahya and I think it's good that we are being looked after,"" he told IRIN. Originally from the northwestern province of Kermanshah in Iran, which borders Iraq, he lived with his family for 20 years in the Al-Tash camp. ""We were living in mud houses there too often with no electricity,"" he said, adding that the only water nearby was in the Euphrates River. ""We used to survive by selling goods to Arab villages,"" he explained. ""I heard that the situation in Iraq was going to worsen so I made plans for me and my family. Smugglers who spoke Kurdish brought me over the border, charging US $350 per person. My family went home to Iran but I could not return as I belong to a political party,"" he said. When he entered Van he said he went to UNHCR and the police to register, a condition to be carried out within 10 days of arrival if you want to seek asylum in the country. ""I am not able to work so my family sold our land to pay for me to stay here,"" he added. THE MOVE Although Iranians in Turkey are looking forward to being able to work legally in the country, the move is not without complications. Some refugees have complained of having to pay huge amounts of money - up to $1,000 for a family of six - for a residence permit. UNHCR says it is seeking to negotiate this with the authorities, trying to have the fee reduced where possible under Turkish law. Legally, the fee cannot be waived and with refugees only able to earn up to US $15 per day, many cannot pay the fee immediately. ""The main issue for the UN is safe arrival and accommodation of the refugees and the situation is being monitored,"" the head of the UNHCR office in Van, Carolyn Ennis, told IRIN. ""The refugees are often brought in by smugglers who have made big business out of them, but they are often abused by them and are scared of them,"" she added.

The local authorities say the new refugee agreement is best all round. ""They cannot work so there are problems for us. They get involved in crimes such as burglaries and even some murders,"" the Governor of Van, Hikmet Tan, told IRIN. ""They are jobless and they need work to survive and support their families, but they can't work here so the move will give them better opportunities,"" he added. ""Normally we don't accept such refugees, but we know that they cannot return home so we accepted them,"" Tan explained. ""We want them to move on to Europe, but this is a slow process and we want it to be speeded up,"" he stressed, adding that the Iranians did, however, have the right to education in Turkey. UNHCR has worked closely with TEGV and many refugee children have been able to attend the school in addition to those already attending Turkish public schools. The refugee population in Van, including the Iranians, stood at 2,740 at the end of March. In the year 2000, with TEGV already admitting hundreds of local children, also agreed to accept refugee children between the ages of seven and 15, along with 10 volunteer refugee teachers, but that was now down to 26 children and four teachers, following the transfer of Iranians from Iraq to satellite cities. Sitting in the busy headquarters of Van police station, the head of the Aliens Department in the city, Tayfun Bora, outlined some concerns he had. The burly man, dressed in a smart navy blue uniform with a pistol strapped to his trouser belt and golden crests on his shoulders depicting his seniority, said the situation of refugees was far better now than three years ago. ""There used to be around 3,000 and now there are now about 2,000. We thought there would be a movement of thousands following the war but this did not happen,"" he told IRIN. ""There was a case some time ago where an Iranian killed a police officer and a local person was found dead in a canal. Following investigations it was found that an Iranian refugee was the culprit, so there are some concerns,"" he said. ""They are not living in an isolated place and we are not pushy on their work situation. We know they have to survive and make ends meet,"" he said, referring to those working illegally in Van city. Additionally, refugees and asylum seekers are given financial assistance from UNHCR depending on the size of the family. Many are also receiving assistance from relatives in Iran such as flour, oil and sugar, brought over the border by bus drivers. TURKISH REFUGEE LAW

Turkey is a signatory to the Convention for Refugees, but does not grant asylum to those coming from the east. However, UNHCR has undertaken to seek resettlement on behalf of those asylum seekers who enter Turkey through its eastern borders and who are recognised refugees. Under current Turkish refugee law, all refugees entering the country should register with the police within 10 days or they lose the right to be able to seek asylum. Under Article 33 of the Convention on Refugees, Iranian refugees must not be forced to return to the country where they claim fear of persecution. In addition, UNHCR is calling on governments not to repatriate refugees from Iraq due to poor security. REFUGEE CASELOAD The caseload in Turkey is representative of Iranian society as a whole including persons from various ethnic, religious and social backgrounds, including members of the Bahai faith. In many instances, due to Iranian legislation, many Bahais may face discrimination that can amount to persecution. Those who enter Turkey illegally generally cross the borders with smugglers without documents and are required under the law of the land to register in the border province where they entered. Most are registered in Van, and in the neighbouring provinces of Agri and Hakkari. Once the refugees register with the UN agency, every effort is made to get a decision on their status as soon as possible. Those who are recognised as refugees in accordance with UNHCR's Statute and the 1951 Convention on Refugees are submitted to resettlement countries, while those whose applications are rejected may appeal the decision. ""We try and resolve a case within four months,"" Ennis said.

""Those refugees who have been around for several years have in many instances had their case closed but have not moved on yet after the authorities have served a notice to them following appeal,"" she added. The UNHCR official explained that there had been recent reports that two groups of Iranian refugees were deported but was unable to confirm this, adding that local police were trying to refer cases but were also working under difficult circumstances. While official estimates indicate that as many as 70,000 migrants seeking to travel to western destinations may transit Turkey annually, the caseload of refugees and asylum seekers averaging roughly around 4,000 annually represents a very small percentage of the overall number of persons entering and travelling through the vast country. ""UNHCR is seeking to assist the authorities in identifying and providing protection to the asylum seekers and refugees who may enter Turkey in the same manner as the migrants but who are in need of international protection,"" Ennis added. Back at the TEGV school, refugees who've had a tough time say all they want is to be able to live a normal life again. ""It took me a long time to find friends here and speak the language,"" Karima, a 17-year-old girl with sculptured features and big brown eyes, told IRIN, in a shaky voice as she reminisced the trauma she had encountered in moving from country to country. ""Its been a hard life,"" she said as her lip quivered and she burst into uncontrollable tears with her sobbing mother comforting her. ""We've been through a lot and we want to move abroad now,"" she added."
Arab League prepares for Iraq reconciliation conference,"Delegates of the 22-member Arab League met on Thursday in Cairo to discuss the proposed agenda for the upcoming Iraq reconciliation conference, scheduled to begin on November 19. ""This conference is the first step on the long path to achieving Iraqi reconciliation,"" said league Secretary General Amr Moussa at a press conference following the two-hour meeting. The league’s Cairo headquarters will provide the venue for the conference, which, Moussa explained, will aim to establish a date for more comprehensive talks to be held early next year. ""This conference is only the first step,"" the league head told journalists. Moussa initially won support for the reconciliation initiative from a number of Iraqi groups during his visit to Iraq in October. While Moussa didn’t give any details on who specifically would be invited, it is expected that representatives from Iraq’s multi-farious religious sects and political groupings would be present at the conference. The event comes at a time when the divide between the majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni communities increases in the run up to elections in December. Responding to questions raised by journalists about whether the event would be internationalised to include non-Arab players, such as the US, the UK or Russia, Moussa insisted the event would be, at its core, an Iraqi affair. ""Only Iraqis will be involved in the process,"" he said. He added, however, that the tricky subject of Iraqi reconciliation was the responsibility of all Arab nations. ""I hope there will be greater coordination between Arab countries to make this event successful,"" he said. Despite the league chief’s optimism, no details were given on the conference’s agenda, which, according to Moussa, would be worked out among invitees. Critics have questioned the league’s delayed responses to the deteriorating situation in Iraq, which has been occupied by US-led Coalition forces since early 2003. Nevertheless, Moussa confirmed the pan-Arab organisation’s longstanding commitment to the issue. ""The Arab League is the body that proposed reconciliation,” he said, “and it has done so at a time when all parties involved are ready to achieve that important goal.” On Friday, the foreign ministers of eight Arab countries – including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria, Algeria, Jordan, Iraq and Bahrain – are expected to hold a meeting to discuss the upcoming conference."
NGOs divided over progress in Iraq one year on,"One year after the US-led war in Iraq, aid agencies are divided about the success of efforts on the ground to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis. Some see tangible results and genuine progress under difficult circumstances while others feel that little has changed to raise the quality of life. Norwegian People's Aid (NPA), which does mine removal in central Iraq, says it has been able to help people in measurable ways. The NGO, which is partly funded by the Norwegian government, has been in Iraq since April. ""After we have been here a year, we will have achieved things that are measurable and noticeable. When we leave, other agencies will carry on the work,"" NPA worker Tony Fish told IRIN in Baghdad. Others praise progress made by Iraqis in rebuilding institutions but lament that poor security is obscuring positive developments. ""Progress is being made, but... it takes time,"" Alexander Christof, a project director at the German-based Architects for People in Need, told IRIN. ""It's a pleasure to work with the ministries, but with the decreasing security it's a very tough situation."" An international aid worker, who declined to be named, also recognised some positive developments. The worker said that important ideas were beginning to take hold in Iraqi society, reflected in the push for 25 percent of the seats in the new parliament to be set aside for women. But these things were not enough for Iraqis to forget the dismal infrastructure problems, security fears and lack of jobs, the aid worker said. ""These are the things that people measure their lives by; not necessarily intangible things like freedom and democracy."" ""What has improved? There is no improvement in electricity at three hours on, three hours off. Take that as a litmus test. What can you see that's tangible?"", the aid worker asked rhetorically. Such an unstable situation has also made the ""black [market] business"" that flourished during the war still viable, Pascal Marlinge, head of the Italian-based Intersos office in Iraq, told IRIN in Baghdad. In addition, international agencies have not necessarily been able to provide for all of people's needs due to limited operational capacity, leaving political factions at times to fill the gap, Marlinge said. He points to Kurdish political groups in the north who have offered shelter and food to people thrown out by competing ethnic groups in various disputes over housing and land. One important factor that has pared back aid agency operations in Iraq is the lack of security. In the week leading up to the first anniversary of the US-led invasion, violence escalated as many had feared. On Monday two Finnish businessmen were shot dead on their way to the Electricity Ministry. The ongoing instability in the country has led many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to keep a lower profile, driving in local vehicles and moving staff around frequently from office to office. But despite such measures security cannot be guaranteed. Just over a week ago, five aid workers working on a water project in northern Iraq were killed as they drove in Mosul. Many of the 80 or so international aid agencies operating in Iraq have also relocated their international staff outside Iraq to countries such as Jordan or Kuwait, leaving only local staff on the ground. ""Here, it doesn't matter if you're neutral or not,"" an aid worker, who declined to be named, told IRIN. ""Certain groups here want to carry out certain attacks against the international community."" The UN itself pulled international staff members out of Iraq following the attack on its Baghdad headquarters in August, which killed 23 and injured scores more. However, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said late on Friday in response to a letter from the Iraqi Governing Council that the UN would send a team back to Iraq to help with the transfer of sovereignty later this year. ""I have written to the Security Council and to the Iraqi Governing Council and the CPA [Coalition Provisional Authority] advising them that I do intend to send a team back to Baghdad, led by [Special Adviser Lakhdar] Brahimi, to work with the Iraqis on the political transitional arrangements leading to the formation of a government on 30 June,"" Annan said. Some aid agencies welcomed the move, saying that it gives some hope that the security situation may be improving. But others were unwilling to comment on this or any other matter relating to security in Iraq, reflecting a reluctance to speak to the media for safety reasons."
Islamic groups demand release of kidnapped aid workers in Iraq,"Islamic scholars and groups from the Middle East and Asia attending a conference in the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, have issued a joint statement demanding the immediate release of four kidnapped aid workers in Iraq. “We, the undersigned, call for the immediate release of the four western peace activists who were kidnapped in Iraq last week. We have been saddened by the kidnapping of these peace activists whose only mission in Iraq has been to express solidarity with the Iraqi people and see for themselves the devastating effects of the U.S. invasion of Iraq,” the statement said. On 26 November, two Canadians, a US and British citizen were kidnapped by an Iraqi militant group calling itself the Swords of Truth, which accused them of being spies. The kidnappers threatened to kill the hostages by Friday evening unless certain Iraqi prisoners held by US and local forces were released. The hostage takers also called for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq. “They were intending to return home to inform the public opinion in their own countries about the destruction and havoc brought about by the invasion of Iraq by the United States of America and its allies,” the statement added. The statement was issued by more than 25 Islamic groups from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, India and Pakistan. It was released during a conference discussing the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories organised by the Al-Quds International Foundation and held in the Yemeni capital. Mohammed Qathan, head of the political branch of Al-Islah Party, the second largest political party in Yemen attending the conference, told IRIN in Sana’a that killing the aid workers would be ""inhumane and un-Islamic"". “Such peace activists should have been welcomed into Iraq and treated as honourable guests instead of being kidnapped and used as a bargaining chip. Neither the hostages nor the organisation they represent possess the means of forcing the occupation authorities to free the Iraqis held in its detention centres across Iraq,” the statement said."
New military rulers face worldwide condemnation,"Mauritanians woke to a new dawn on Thursday following the bloodless ousting of President Maaouya Ould Taya, with many in triumphant mood but anxious to hear more from the Military Council for Justice and Democracy, which staged the coup but promised to stand down within two years. In a statement carried on the state news agency, the council said it was composed of 17 members from the various branches of the armed forces, with all but one carrying the rank of colonel, and would usher in civilian rule within two years. Named at the council's head was Col Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, who took part in the putsch that brought Ould Taya to power in 1984 and who had served at his side as the nation's security chief for almost two decades. While hundreds of people took to the streets in the hours after the coup on Wednesday, honking car horns and shouting slogans like ""Long Live the Putschists"", things were calmer by Thursday and people were going about their normal business, waiting for the council's next moves. Small crowds gathered in front of the city's prison, hopeful that rumours about a mass release of Islamic political prisoners, who had been locked away under Ould Taya, might be true. ""The new decision-makers have to quickly set the tone if they don't want to be caught out by yesterday's rulers and their allies, especially since these people have the financial clout to destabilise the country,"" said Minetou Mint Mohamed, a civil servant and resident in the capital, Nouakchott. A source inside the council told IRIN on Thursday that a new constitution was expected to be drawn up by Monday at the latest. Meanwhile, Vall moved into the presidential palace in the heart of the sand-blanketed capital, Nouakchott. The former occupant of what locals dubbed the ""Yellow Palace"" was still in Niger. Ould Taya was forced to land there when news of the coup broke as he made his way back from the funeral of King Fahd in Saudi Arabia. Worldwide condemnation With worldwide condemnation raining down on Mauritanian's self-declared new leaders, Vall met with diplomats in Nouakchott and was also due to receive representatives from political parties and civil society, the source said. Analysts pointed to the fact that nobody was killed during the coup and the fact that it happened during a presidential visit that had come about with short notice, as evidence of a broad agreement among the military that Taya had to go. The jubilant scenes on the streets of the capital and other cities suggested more wide-spread popular support for the ousting, they added. But Vall can expect a frosty reception from the international community. ""The thing that everybody is faced with is that they cannot go easy [on the new leaders]. It's a question of the precedent,"" said Mike McGovern, the West Africa project director for the Crisis Group think-tank. ""We have had Togo and Mauritania now in the last six months and we could see several other countries in the next six."" The UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United States, former colonial power France and the European Union have all condemned the seizure of power in Mauritania. On Thursday, the African Union said it was suspending Mauritania's membership of the 53-nation group ""until the restoration of constitutional order in the country."" However, analysts say Ould Taya has few international allies and no-one really has any bargaining power over the Muslim nation that straddles Arab and black Africa. Ould Taya cut himself off from much of sub-Saharan African, pulling out of the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). He also annoyed many Arab allies by establishing diplomatic ties with Israel, turning away from Iraq and towards the United States, and cracking down on Islamists. ""The international community is not going to reverse the situation in Mauritania because no-one has significant leverage,"" said Olly Owen, Africa analyst at London-based research group Global Insight. Keeping promises? So if outside attempts to restore the constitutional order do fail, what happens next? The military council pledged in its debut statement to create favourable conditions for democracy, which they estimate will take two years at most. A source inside the council told IRIN on Thursday that Vall wanted the transition to happen as soon as possible. But some opposition politicians were giving events a wary welcome. ""In this crisis situation, a regime change was inevitable. But we would have wished that this be done in a controlled democratic way with all the parties involved,"" Messaoud Ould Boulkheir, the president of the Popular Progressive Alliance party, was quoted as saying by Reuters. Some analysts also expressed scepticism about the coup plotters' democratic credentials, given that many were deeply involved in a ruling elite that was generally considered repressive and they themselves now dub ""totalitarian"". Also potentially complicating any handover is the fact that Mauritania is due to start producing 75,000 barrels of crude oil a day from its offshore Chinguetti field early next year, with hopes of finding more reserves onshore. ""It may be that some members of the council ... find their commitment to democracy slipping ... because the oil money is going to be a very powerful motivator,"" Global Insight's Owen said. ""That tendency may lead to a delayed transition manipulated to allow self-succession by members of the new clique,"" he went on. ""The best way to avert such a scenario is for the regional and international community to engage constructively with the new situation in such a way as to discourage that tendency before it emerges."""
Netherlands military hospital operational,"As part of NATO’s assistance to earthquake-devastated northern Pakistan, the first military field hospital from the Netherlands began operating on Wednesday in the central Bagh district of Pakistani-administered Kashmir. ""Starting from a 40-bed in-patient care facility, the medical facility will provide care in the areas of general surgery, obstetrics, paediatrics and dentistry,"" Dr Chris Bleeker, an anaesthetist in charge of the operating theatre, said on Wednesday in Bagh town, 200 km north of from Pakistani capital, Islamabad. The first patient was an elderly man with a fractured leg who was evacuated four weeks ago from Bagh, and was initially treated at a military hospital in Rawalpindi, close to Islamabad. But on Wednesday, after being discharged from the medical facility, his leg wound started bleeding on return to Bagh. NATO is airlifting urgently needed supplies to Pakistan and deploying engineers, medical units and specialist equipment to assist in relief operations after the devastating 8 October earthquake that has killed at least 86,000 people and injured more than 100,000. The NATO relief operation has been launched through two air bridges, from Germany and Turkey. More than 70 flights have airlifted over 1,110 mt of supplies, including thousands of tents, stoves and blankets necessary to protect millions of survivors from the cold. In addition, NATO is in the process of deploying more than 1,000 specialist troops, mainly engineers and medical units to assist in the relief effort. The Dutch field hospital is staffed by over 160 personnel, mainly from medical and engineering fields, along with some staff for security and safety purposes. However, more nurses and doctors from the UK, the Czech Republic and Macedonia will join the medical facility next week. Dutch mobile medical teams, each with around 8 to 10 members, have already been helping patients in areas around Bagh since the team arrived last week from the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e Sharif, Bleeker said. The medical teams are equipped with three ambulances and several 4x4 vehicles to get to mountainous villages. Almost 80 percent of the health infrastructure in Bagh has been damaged by the earthquake, according to local government. The NATO hospital is the second field hospital in Bagh, after Belgium-based Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) opened an emergency medical facility in the area in the days after the attack. As part of the ongoing relief efforts for quake-victims in Pakistan, the Netherlands has contributed at least US $50 million worth of equipment, including 500 winterised tents with capacity for 8 to 10 people, 500 heaters, 5,000 blankets, 500 mattresses and 120 stretchers. On Tuesday, together with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Joint Logistics Centre (UNJLC) and the UK-based Islamic Relief NGO as implementing partners, the tents have been lifted to remote mountain villages in Haveli, a district of Bagh."
"Interview with vice-president of Iraq, Ibrahim al-Jaffari","Ibrahim al-Jaffari, interim vice-president of Iraq, and the man tipped to be the country's next prime minister, said the priorities for the country now are security, reconstruction and the future of Fallujah among others. Jaffari was part of the Shi'ite United Iraqi Alliance group, which took some 48 percent of the vote in the 30 January poll to elect a 275-member transitional assembly. The alliance has been allocated 140 seats. In an interview with IRIN in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, the high-ranking politician spoke about the need for aid agencies in the country, the importance of security for them and for the Iraqi people in order to build a strong and prosperous country. QUESTION: What are the priorities for Iraq today? ANSWER: Security is the main priority in Iraq. It's really a challenge for us because security is affecting citizens’ lives. Insecurity affects the image of the government and gives an impression of weakness. After this you have the public services like water and power, as well as the economy, and [tackling] these issues has been delayed as a result of insecurity. Q: How will you increase security in the country? A: The first step is to end any leaks [of information] in security which are responsible for the mess. We don't want the treatment to be superficial [in dealing with this problem], it should deal with the root causes. These leaks are the main reasons for this poor security and [addressing this] is going to be our first step. [The leaking of information comes from] people from the last regime who are helping insurgents in the country, and people who came from outside the country to work as insurgents. Some unemployed people, due to the poor economic situation, have gone to the resistance as a way of getting money for their families. These people have been brain-washed with the culture that killing and blood are the solutions. We should also solve the problems with neighbouring countries by not letting foreign [insurgents] pass through our borders without authorisation and have control of the country’s borders. Q: Many Fallujah city residents are still camped outside the city, living in very poor conditions and reconstruction in the town is slow. How is the government going to help those families? A: Fallujah, Najaf [in the south] and other cities that were almost completely destroyed due to insurgency require special management. Reconstruction and compensation for the things lost are the main issues because it wasn't our aim to destroy the city, but we intended to remove the insurgents who entered the city and used it as their base. We don't have anything against the people of the cities, its residents, streets, buildings or schools. Now the priorities are to compensate the people and bring back the smiles and shine to the city with the blessing of God. Q: Kirkuk has been another point of conflict recently with reports of huge Arab displacement from the city as Kurds return. How are you dealing with this? A: A very important strategy should be used with regards to Kirkuk and it will be one of the main issues for the new national assembly. Kirkuk is a very sensitive case due to its ethnic and religious diversity and we will ensure that the city is part of Iraq for all Iraqis. Q: How long do you want Coalition troops to stay in the country? A: The presence of Coalition troops in the country depends on the security situation in Iraq. It is true that it is not the case that you can feel strong because you have foreign forces in your country, [as] it indicates that we have problems and the country is weak and cannot protect itself. It gives a bad impression but we cannot protect ourselves and we cannot ask them to leave since even with their presence we are still having problems and a challenge with the terrorists. If they leave the situation could really get worse, so we will ask them at the right time to leave the country. As we build a good force to protect the country, it will decrease step by step our need for them until we can create our own defences. Q: What are the reconstruction priorities? A: Iraq is a country suffering from many years of war and sanctions as well as destruction of government buildings. The economy and security were totally destroyed. Iraq has sources of money, it's a rich country, especially because of its oil. We have capacity to rebuild it again so we believe that it's a good chance to reactivate the reconstruction process in all areas. Iraq from its origin was a civilised country but due to the problems that the country is going through now this social level has decreased. We wish to use all the experience of Iraqis for reconstruction and we will ask foreign countries to invest with Iraqis and help in reconstruction. Q: There are reports that Shari'at law will be part of the new constitution and women in Iraq are afraid it will decrease their rights after all these years. How will you proceed on this issue? A: We won't make the new constitution based only on the Quran [the Islamic holy book]. It is true that the majority of Iraqis are Muslims, but we will try to take many constitutions from around the world and use them as references for us to bring the best for Iraqi people. Women will have their rights and if there are women with competency and specialisations to take high places in the government, it will be a pleasure for us. Q: With ongoing kidnappings and other security issues, nearly all international NGOs and aid agencies have left the country. How are you going to encourage them to return? A: First of all, again the security issue. We will offer them protection and guards and help them with any difficulties in their way, so they will be able to offer their services to the country. We need them and for this reason we will do anything to help and give them the opportunity to help us and help Iraq. In partnership with the NGOs we will get through this critical situation in our country and with God’s blessing we will take away all the barriers in their way. Q: How has the withdrawal of the UN affected development? A: I can say that it really affected us, especially on the humanitarian front. The death of Sergio Vieira de Mello [UNs Special Representative for Iraq], who was a very close and special friend of mine, broke an important step of the UN inside the country and I told UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that Sergio Vieira de Mello came to Iraq to stay forever and truly he stayed forever. I'm sure the UN will be back and we will see good days. Q: What do you think lies in the future for Iraq? A: I think that Iraq was waiting for a new birth and it got it on the 30 January of this year. Iraq took its first step in building its future, not only politically, but socially. The curve has started to increase with democracy spreading in the country and it is the first step for our democratic future in Iraq. The next step will be with less wrongs and a higher participation from the Iraqi people, as many of those who didn't participate in the first election will participate in the next one after the increase in security in the country. For this reason I see Iraq's future full with brightness and happiness."
Iraq gears up for vote on new constitution opposed by Sunnis,"Iraq votes in a referendum on Saturday whether to approve or reject a new constitution, but Islamic insurgents have vowed to disrupt the ballot and the country’s disaffected Sunni minority is split over whether or not to take part. Sunni Muslims account for 15 to 20 percent of Iraq’s 26 million population and dominated politics and government under deposed President Sadam Hussein and are overwhelmingly opposed to the US-backed government in Baghdad. Most Sunnis fear they will be sidelined by the new constitution, which gives more power and influence to the Shia majority in the south and the Kurdish population in the north. The Islamist insurgency against the US-led military forces in Iraq draws most of its support from the Sunni community, which largely abstained from voting in parliamentary elections in January. Diplomats are worried that the increasing alienation of Sunnis from Iraq’s US-backed transition towards democracy could give new strength to the insurgency and tear the country apart. Amr Moussa, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, told the BBC on Saturday that Iraq was on the verge of civil war. “The situation is so tense…a civil war could erupt at any moment, although some people would say it is already there,” the Cairo-based diplomat said. With only a few days to go before the 15 October referendum, Sunni leaders remained split over whether to boycott the poll or participate and vote ‘no.’ They emerged from a meeting in a Baghdad mosque on Saturday still divided on the issue. “We do not ask the Iraqi people to boycott or not,” said Harith al-Dhari, the head of the Muslim Clerics’ Association told Reuters as he emerged from the meeting. But he stressed; “We ask them to do everything they legitimately can to reject the draft of the constitution.” Tampering with the rules Despite their minority status in Iraq as a whole, the Sunnis could in theory block adoption of the new constitution by voting massively against it in the three provinces of the country where they form the majority. These are Anbar in the west, where US forces launched a pre-referendum offensive against insurgent forces earlier this month, and Salaheddin and Nineveh in northern Iraq. The rules of the referendum state that the new constitution will be rejected if it is defeated by a two thirds majority in just three of the country’s 18 provinces. However, Iraq’s Shia-dominated parliament incensed Sunnis at the last moment by trying to make it more difficult for them to defeat the constitution. An amendment to the referendum law on 2 October insisted that two thirds of the registered electorate in three provinces would have to vote ‘no,’ rather than two thirds of those who actually voted. Following a protest by the United Nations, parliament repealed this amendment three days later, but the episode did nothing to build Sunni confidence in Iraq’s fledgling democracy. Nearly 15 million Iraqis are eligible to vote in the referendum which will take place amid tight security to prevent insurgent attacks on polling stations and the intimidation of voters. Thousands of police will be on the streets, vehicle movements will be restricted and one local television station reported that a curfew would be imposed 24 hours before the poll to prevent people moving outside their homes at night The constitution was drafted by a 55-member committee representing all of Iraq’s sectarian and ethnic groups. It debated the draft constitution for most of the summer before producing a final document on 28 August. However, the final wording of the constitution was rejected by all 15 Sunni members of the drafting committee. They disagreed above all with its adoption of a federal government for Iraq, this gives the Kurds and the Shias stronger powers over Iraq’s two main oil-producing regions in the north and south of the country. They also feared that derogatory references in the constitution to the Ba’ath Party, which held power under Sadam Hussein, would lead to a purge of Sunnis in positions of authority in public life. Preparing the vote The referendum will be supervised by the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq, which in recent weeks has been distributing five million copies of the proposed new constitution to prospective voters. “We have put all our efforts to prepare for the first democratic referendum in Iraq,” said commission spokesman Farid Ayar. “The insecurity in Iraq sometimes delayed our work but we are positive that we will finish everything within the coming days,” he added. With the support of the United Nations, the electoral commission, has trained more than 100,000 people to staff polling stations across the country. It has also carried out a publicity campaign through leaflets distributed to homes and messages broadcast on radio and television, urging people to vote. “We are working hard to prevent mistakes or doubts about the transparency of our work in the referendum day,” Ayar said. Iraq’s political parties have also been given the right to distribute leaflets and to publicise their views about the referendum in radio and television advertisements. The poll will be monitored by nearly 500 accredited international observers."
UNHCR closes two iris verification centres in Pakistan,"As the number of Afghans repatriating to their homeland falls, the UN refugee agency has announced the closure of two of its iris scanning centres in Pakistan, which had been set up to verify the entitlement of returnees to avail themselves of repatriation assistance. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was operating four Iris Verification Centres (IVCs) at its four departure centres in the two Pakistani cities of Peshawar and Quetta, located close to the Afghan border. Iris verification is a requirement for every Afghan over the age of six wishing to receive the UNHCR repatriation assistance package. According to the UNHCR press statement, Afghan refugees returning from the NWFP (North-West Frontier Province) and Punjab will now be processed only at the Hayatabad IVC in Peshawar. Refugees returning from Balochistan will go through the Baleli IVC in Quetta while those from Sindh can use either centre before exiting Pakistan, the statement said. The number of returning refugees reaches a peak in the summer and is minimal during the harsh Afghan winter, the UNHCR statement said. The unique iris-recognition technology was introduced by UNHCR in September 2002 to ensure that assistance was given only to deserving Afghan refugees. The process detects anyone who has previously been through the procedure and tries to claim return assistance a second time. The iris verification process takes an image of an iris, storing it in the form of a number without recording the person's name, gender, age or destination. The technology has no effect on the eye. Due to cultural sensitivities, UNHCR female repatriation staff check female Afghan returnees to ensure that their faces are not seen by male staff. The UNHCR's voluntary repatriation programme is scheduled to run until March 2006 under a tripartite agreement between the UNHCR and the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Over 2.26 million Afghan refugees have returned to Afghanistan so far with UNHCR assistance since the repatriation programme started in March 2002, the agency statement said."
Red Crescent continues work in Iraq under difficult circumstances,"At a time when very few aid agencies are able to operate within Iraq, the United Arab Emirates’ Red Crescent Association (RC) says the risks are high but that they will continue to assist the needy with a small team of workers inside the country. “The situation is extremely dangerous and it is a challenge, but we are able to operate due to the trust and reputation we have managed to build for ourselves there,” UAE Red Crescent Secretary General, Sana’a Darwish Al-Kitby, told IRIN from its Abu Dhabi headquarters. As well as delivery of much needed relief items from the UAE, an office has also been established in Baghdad, with some four staff members supported by the UAE embassy in the Iraqi capital. “We are assisting in all parts of the country when requested by the government. We do not discriminate against the different ethnic groups, we will assist anyone in need,” she stressed. Al-Kitby herself visited Iraq once in October 2003 and described the situation as very demanding. “The purpose of my visit was to get first hand knowledge of the humanitarian situation in Iraq and to visit the ongoing UAE Red Crescent operations in the country.” “The UAE Red Crescent needs to continue its cooperation with the Iraqi people,” the dynamic secretary general added. So far, some US $35 million has been spent on Iraq since the RC entered to assist prior to the April 2003 war. Supplies such as medicine, vaccines, blankets, tents and food items such as dates, rice and sugar, as well as first aid kits have been delivered. In addition, generators for hospitals and water treatment plants across the country have also been provided. Al-Kitby pointed out that the association was now assisting in more than 100 countries world-wide, with an annual budget of 10 million AED (US $ 2.7 million). Some 70 injured Iraqis have been brought into the UAE for urgent medical treatment since the 2003 war started due to the lack of skilled doctors and medical facilities in Iraq. Another 300 Iraqis in the UAE have been assisted with shelter and voluntary repatriation to their homeland. “We coordinated with the ICRC and made sure that we were in Iraq in time for the crisis. This was important to us as they [Iraq] are also a neighbour of ours,” she added. Speaking about ongoing collaboration with other aid agencies, she said: “The UAE Red Crescent is still exploring other means and partners to work with, to be able to deliver its humanitarian mandate not only in Iraq, but all over the world without regard to race, religion or nationality.”"
"UNHCR head announces closure of ""new"" refugee camps in Pakistan","Refugee camps set up by Pakistan to accommodate Afghans fleeing their homeland after the US-led war on terror began in Afghanistan in late 2001 will be closed by September, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced on Monday. Ruud Lubbers told a news conference at the conclusion of a three-nation tour, where he met officials in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan to focus on the refugee situation, that he had discussed the matter in detail with both the president and prime minister of Pakistan. About 200,000 residents remain in so-called ""new"" camps, located close to Pakistan's long and often porous border with Afghanistan. The new camps were set up to cope with the exodus of frightened Afghans fleeing their country after a US-led war campaign to dislodge the Taliban started in October 2001. ""They cannot count any longer on staying here. It's not fair to the Pakistanis to do that,"" Lubbers told IRIN after he concluded his press conference in the capital, Islamabad. Returning refugees, nearly two million of whom have travelled home to Afghanistan from Pakistan since the UNHCR repatriation process began in March 2002, are usually given a travel grant - which can range from US $3 to $30 - along with an extra US $8 instead of food and other assistance extended in previous years, according to an UNHCR press release. ""They get a fair amount of cash grants to go home and we add to that in certain situations and they make quick decisions. But the basic motivation is that there is no alternative to moving from here,"" Lubbers said, in response to an IRIN query that focused on how a still uncertain security situation in Afghanistan would affect refugees' decisions to return to their country. Earlier, Lubbers had explained the need to close the ""new"" camps, pointing to growing security concerns that spoke of Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces possibly finding sanctuary and conducting recruiting in the camps near the border. He added: ""We think it's really not good to continue the situation there, it's not good for the people who are living there, it's not good for Pakistan, it's not good for Afghanistan."" UNHCR is repatriating Afghans from Pakistan under a tripartite agreement with the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan that runs until 2006. In his meetings with Pakistani officials, Lubbers said he had expressed the hope that, after the expiry of the agreement, the remaining Afghans in Pakistan might be accommodated under other arrangements, such as work permits, the UNHCR press statement said. According to the Pakistani government's estimates, the Afghan population in Pakistan totals over three million. But Lubbers said in the absence of any accurate information, UNHCR believes the total figure might be lower, the press release added. Nearly 60,000 Afghans have returned to their homeland after the restart of the repatriation process in March this year, following a five-month suspension after a UNHCR staffer was brutally murdered in Afghanistan in November. Lubbers said UNHCR planned to help another half a million return in 2004. ""The planning figure is 400,000. But, 400,000 is a modest estimate. We can do more,"" he stressed."
Twin earthquakes claim 24 lives in Pakistan's north,"A disaster-hit rural populace in Pakistan’s North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), their homes and belongings destroyed or damaged by two moderate-intensity earthquakes that claimed at least 24 lives and injured dozens of others on Saturday, were still waiting for government-pledged aid to arrive on Monday, according to an official. “No government aid has arrived so far. The federal government said they were sending some tents and other aid but nothing has reached here so far,” Attaullah Khan, the Nazim (administrator) for Batgram, one of the worst-hit sub-districts, told IRIN. The provincial government had also pledged aid but none had arrived, Khan added. “The people in Islamabad said they were sending a truckful of aid, but it hasn’t reached here so far,” he maintained. The two earthquakes hit the mountainous region of Pakistan’s north about an hour and a half apart in the afternoon on Saturday, levelling mud-houses, starting landslides and injuring dozens. An official at the Peshawar Seismic Centre said the earthquakes, which measured 5.7 and 5.4 respectively on the Richter Scale, were of moderate intensity. “We will be able to pinpoint the exact epicentre of the earthquake after we’ve received data from the rest of Pakistan,” Mahmood Ahmed, a meteorologist at the seismic centre, told IRIN from Peshawar. The earthquakes were felt all across the NWFP and stretched across Pakistani-controlled Kashmir to Srinagar in the section of the disputed valley controlled by India, Ahmed added. Residents in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, also reported tremors which caused high-rise buildings to sway disconcertingly for a few moments. However, the impact was experienced at its worst in towns and villages across the NWFP, particularly in the districts of Mansehra and sub-districts, Balakot and Batgram, where residents were reported to have spent a second night in sub-zero conditions out in the open after their homes were damaged or destroyed by the quakes. The worst single disaster occurred in Batgram sub-district when a heavily-laden passenger van was struck by a falling boulder after a landslide was triggered off by the earthquakes. Ghulam Sarwar, a local police official, told IRIN that 13 bodies had been recovered from the vehicle, which was knocked off the narrow mountain road, by the force of the impact, and fell into a river. Sarwar said it was difficult to gauge just how bad the situation was in areas and settlements beyond the few roads that snake across the Hindukush mountain range because snow-blocked roads and the rugged, difficult terrain made it difficult for squads sent on humanitarian scouting missions to return quickly. Hundreds of homes and other buildings had been destroyed or damaged with fearful residents camping out in the freezing cold, as they awaited help, Khan, the district administrator, said. But locals had rallied to help each other out. “If someone’s house collapsed, his neighbours are helping him out,” Khan added. In the meantime, reports of more injured people were continuing to filter in, he maintained. “This is difficult terrain, it’s mountainous, there’s snow and no telephones, so the news is continuing to filter in,” he added. Another tremor early on Sunday hadn’t served to alleviate fears, he said. “There was another earthquake here this morning. The people here are very frightened,” Khan added."
Military involvement in DRC unlikely,"Angola is unlikely to get involved in any military intervention in support of the government in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to an analyst with the Luanda-based think-tank, Centre for Strategic Studies. The analyst was responding to reports of rising tensions in the DRC and a trip to Kinshasa, capital of the DRC, by Angolan foreign affairs minister Joao Miranda this week. The Angolan Press Agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesperson as describing the situation in the DRC as ""worrying"". In the past month, the Kinshasa government has been confronted both by a coup attempt, and the temporary capture of the eastern town of Bukavu by dissident troops, who it alleged were backed by neighbouring Rwanda. The UN Security Council on Tuesday urged Rwanda not to provide any practical or political support to armed groups in the DRC, and it encouraged leaders in DRC, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi ""to work together to reduce tensions and restore confidence in the region"". The Angolan news agency reported the foreign ministry spokesperson as saying Miranda's visit was aimed at expressing ""solidarity and the availability of Angola to help the transitional institutions [in the DRC] in order to guarantee security, stability of the country and a peaceful transition of the peace process"". Given the history of conflict in the region, when Rwandan and Ugandan forces backed rebels against the Kinshasa government, the think-tank's analyst noted that ""the DRC will need all the allies it can get in the region"". However, ""The Angolan military will play no role in the DRC - we have not been involved there for a long time,"" he commented. Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe supported Kinshasa during several years of war against rebel forces backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Angola pulled its troops out of the DRC in 2002. The analyst added that any instability in the DRC ""means the possibility of refugees coming into Angola, and arms trafficking at the border"", which would burden Angola's limited resources to police its borders."
Human security and the “tug-o-war of agendas”,"There were 57 major armed conflicts in various parts of the world between 1990 and 2001, according to the 2003 edition of the Human Development Report (HDR 2003), an annual publication of the United Nations Development Programme. An estimated 3.6 million people died in these conflicts. Most were civilians and the overwhelming majority were in Africa. Millions were wounded. Millions more had to flee their homes. The need for action to prevent such conflicts and the suffering they cause has rarely been as strong as it now is. This need has been highlighted at various fora and has led to a number of initiatives, not least the establishment of conflict prevention strategies and mechanisms by regional and global bodies such as the United Nations, the European Union and the African Union, as well as civil society groups. At the same time, a global focus on security as a result of the US-led ‘War on Terror’ has given rise to a new set of questions as to the nature of so-called ‘humanitarian intervention’, including the question of when, if ever, it is appropriate for states to take coercive – and in particular military – action against another state for the purpose of protecting people there. This focus may have helped to raise a sense of urgency in tackling conflicts but, according to some development actors, it has also highlighted the complex relationship between development and security. Of particular concern to development agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is the extent to which the resurgence of a unilateralist, military approach to intervention and the ‘War on Terror’ has led to a prioritisation of the security agenda, shifting the emphasis from the fight against poverty to the fight against terrorism. World Bank President James Wolfensohn remarked at a conference in Shanghai, China, in May that increasingly less attention was being given to the problems that come with poverty. “Without dealing with that question of poverty, there can’t be any peace, and $900 billion being spent on military expenditure, $300 billion being spent on agricultural subsidies and $50-$60 billion being spent on overseas development assistance is one of the absurdities that we have to change,” he told the Scaling Up Poverty Reduction Conference. [Wolfensohn’s address can be read at www.worldbank.orgpdf Format] The human security concept Since the end of the 1990s, conflict prevention - and especially long-term conflict avoidance- has become the hallmark of the UN, Harvard University academic Adam Smith wrote in the September 2003 issue of Security Dialogue, a quarterly journal co-published by the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo, Norway. In a report to the UN Security Council and UN General Assembly in June 2001, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated that “conflict prevention lies at the heart of the mandate of the UN in the maintenance of international peace and security,” The report, titled ‘The Prevention of Armed Conflict’ suggested that “an effective preventive strategy requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses both short-term and long-term political, diplomatic, humanitarian, human rights, developmental, institutional and other measures taken by the international community, in cooperation with national and regional actors.” [The Secretary-General’s report can be read at www.reliefweb.int] Smith notes that many researchers have also been saying that preventing conflict “requires a degree of focus on both development and security.” In attempting to define and understand this relationship, there has been a greater focus in the security, peace building and development arenas on the concept human security. “The concept of human security, including concern for human rights, but broader than that in its scope, has become an increasingly important element in international law and international relations, increasingly providing a conceptual framework for international action,” the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty noted in a 2001 report titled ‘The Responsibility to Protect’. [This report is available at www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca] The Commission is an independent body set up to support the United Nations by promoting a comprehensive global debate on the relationship between intervention and state sovereignty. It defines human security as: “the security of people, their physical safety, their economic and social well-being, respect for their dignity and worth as human beings, and the protection of their human rights and fundamental freedom.”

Destruction caused by armed conflict in Somalia
This alternative approach, which recasts security in individual terms and legitimises dramatic military intervention only in the case of a clear, verifiable and measured violation of human security, appears to have attracted a broad constituency among academic, diplomatic and foreign policy experts, according to Matthew Scott, senior policy adviser for World Vision. Many see this type of approach as offering a framework that combines the twin demands of development and global security. “If you look at it historically, with the end of the Cold War, it became clear there was a need to develop a new security paradigm,” Dan Smith, director of International Alert, told IRIN. “It was a long awaited opportunity. The paradigm that came through, and really started to be at the forefront of debate and influencing policy, was the human security paradigm.” There are a few core elements to it, Smith explained: “One is that the security of states is important only in so far as it promotes the security of the individual. State sovereignty is not a wall behind which you can gas your citizens. Secondly, human security, because it brings the human into the frame, leads to a much more integrated, holistic view of security, and therefore a deeper view of what the challenges in that landscape are. “The challenges aren’t simply that there is an army on the other side, or there’s a rebellion going on. The challenges lie in poverty, in repression, in regional instability, in the unjust world trade system, and so on,” Smith said. Tug of war between agendas Since 2001, he added, there has been “a tug of war” between the human security agenda, and the one emerging from US President George Bush’s ‘War on Terror.’ “These two agendas are dichotomous,” Smith said. “The human security agenda doesn’t ignore the short- term but puts a lot of emphasis on the long-term. The war of terrorism puts every emphasis on the short-term and forgets about the long-term entirely.” Smith and others have noted that this “tug of war” is also reflected in the European Union Security Strategy (ESS), contained in a report titled ‘A Secure Europe in a Better World: the European Union Security Strategy’, adopted in December 2003 by the European Council. The report puts forward what the EU considers “a comprehensive strategy” to deal with the key security challenges facing Europe – namely, terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflict, state failure and organised crime. [The report is available at www.ueitalia2003.itpdf Format] In adapting to reflect changes in the strategic environment, the EU hopes “to ensure Europe shares in the responsibility for global security and in building a better world,” according to the report. The ESS places emphasis on policy coherence, whereby the full spectrum of EU instruments and activities (military, civilian, diplomatic, trade and development) are used in the pursuit of conflict prevention. It also emphasises the importance of multilateralism, the EU’s commitment to international humanitarian law and the UN Charter. “To be proactive in preventing future violent conflicts, then good governance, poverty eradication, and the fight against what I’ve often called ‘the dark side of globalisation’ – environmental degradation, AIDS, terrorism and international crime – must be placed at the centre of our thinking on both security and development,” Chris Patten, the EU’s external relations commissioner, said in a speech to the Overseas Development Institute in November 2003. [Patten’s address is available at http://europa.eu.int/] Saferworld and International Alert, two NGOs active in the field of conflict prevention, have welcomed this approach, jointly describing it “as an important counterbalance to the ‘War on Terror.’” However, they also highlighted a number of concerns. “The ESS recognises key threats and challenges such as the nexus between conflict, insecurity and poverty; the importance of regional dimensions of conflict; the centrality of good governance; the factors that fuel violent conflict and the need to tackle tools of violence,” Alice Hutchinson, Saferworld Media and Parliamentary Officer, told IRIN. However, “these are not fully reflected in the policy recommendations,” she said. Instead, the policy implications favour prioritising military responses and enhancing military capabilities – including the establishment of a defence agency - over civilian and soft instruments. The ESS also mentions competition for natural resources and energy, and the role of resource revenues, as areas with the potential to fuel conflict and weaken governance. However, it fails to mention them at all in the policy implications, Hutchinson added. International Alert and Saferworld have published a joint paper on the implementation of the European Security Strategy, ‘Strengthening Global Security by Addressing the Root Causes of Conflict: Priorities for the Irish and Dutch presidencies.’ [To view the report go to www.international-alert.orgpdf Format] It highlights four areas where, they say, particular attention should be paid:
The need to link crisis management with conflict prevention
The need to address more fully the root causes of violent conflict
The need to tackle weapons transfers and organised crime; and
The need to engage civil society more fully in the prevention of conflict.
Promoting the human security framework During the Irish government’s 6-month presidency of the European Union (EU), which ended in June 2004, the Irish NGO association, Dóchas, also worked to re-direct what it perceived as a threat to the development agenda within the EU. “For the last few years, starting with the abolition of the Development Council [2002], there have been - bit by bit - changes within the EU so that, without stating it, development aid has simply becoming an instrument of foreign policy,” Hans Zomer, director of Dóchas, told IRIN. “Development aid is becoming secondary to, and subsumed by foreign policy concerns.” During the Irish EU presidency, Dóchas lobbied to redirect the debate by promoting the human security framework, according to Zomer: “We began by looking at the trends within the European Union, and the concerns of our association of 34 NGOs. In particular, the trend towards the ‘securitisation’ of aid was noted, and that’s what we have set out to address.” The aim, in raising awareness and understanding of the Human Security framework, was to “developmentalise foreign policy and security concerns, not the other way round,” he said. He felt their actions had achieved some concrete successes, including the spread of the human security perspective among NGOs and EU governments. “It has touched a chord within NGO and government communities, especially among the new member states,” he told IRIN. The Irish NGO network was also encouraged that its Dutch NGO counterpart, NGO-EU Netwerk, said it would continue lobbying on the human security issue during the Netherlands’s EU presidency, which began in July. [The network’s website is www.europaindewereld.nl] Global security and international reform The United Nations has also been seeking answers to this intricate link between development and security in its search for a better approach to global peace and security, through two high-level panels. As early as 1999, in the 54th session of the General Assembly, Secretary-General Kofi Annan made clear his intention to “address the prospects for human security and intervention in the next century.” In September 2003, he announced the formation of a High-Level Panel to Study Global Security and Reform of the International System. This 16-member group, headed by Thai Prime Minister Ananad Panyarachum, was tasked with “examining the major threats and challenges the world faces in the broad field of peace and security.” Its mandate, according to Canadian academic John Foster responds to two inter-related sets of issues: the consequences of 9/11, including counter-terrorism, the doctrine of pre-emptive intervention, the concept of humanitarian intervention and human security; and the place of the UN in an era with the emergence of one super power, its ‘enforcement’ action without the sanction of the Security Council and the spread of globalisation. Importantly, he notes, its terms of reference take a broad interpretation of the field of peace and security, “that is, it should extend its analysis and recommendations to other issues and institutions, including economy and social.” The panel will meet every two months, until it presents its report on 1 December 2004. [For the Panel’s terms of reference, go to: www.un.orgpdf Format] Another relevant body is the Secretary-General’s Panel of Eminent Persons on Civil Society and UN Relations, created in February 2003. Led by former Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardoso, it is not specifically related to conflict prevention, but touches on another key initiative: the strengthening of multilateralism. “It is no longer between governments, but a global coalition that must try to act together to bring about change,” Sweden’s Birgitta Dahl, one of the panel’s members, told a civil society conference on conflict prevention in Ireland in March. “We should learn to work together in coalitions of the willing for change.” She noted the need to strengthen and support multilateralism as part of this holistic approach to conflict prevention and peace, and to address “democratic deficits,” by supporting institutions, such as parliaments and other members of civil society, that can ensure governments uphold their international commitments. The challenge for civil society The challenge of mobilising Dahl’s “coalition of the willing” for conflict prevention and peace, and strengthening civil society’s relationship with the UN and regional organisations, has been taken up within the NGO and civil society community - at least that is the hope of an NGO initiative called the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict, organised by the Dutch-based European Centre of Conflict Prevention (ECCP). 
[Afghanistan] Deminers at work.
Undoing the harm caused by armed conflict: deminers at work in Afghanistan
Established in 2001 in direct response to Kofi Annan’s call for civil society to engage more fully in conflict prevention, the partnership aims to establish a global network of conflict prevention professionals and organisations to campaign and raise the profile of conflict prevention and human security. At the same time, it seeks to define the role of civil society in this endeavour, in order to legitimise and maximise their contribution in this field, which has lacked some coherence to date. “Unlike in some other areas, such as human rights, the issues of peace and security are still, to a very large extent, an exclusive domain of government and inter-governmental institutions,” said Danilo Turk, the UN’s Assistant-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, in his address at the first conference organised by ECCP in March. That, according to many of the participants and organisers of this conference, needs to change. From the Dublin conference, attended by over 250 people from the Western European region, and hosted by the Irish government, a set of common principles and recommendations was developed on conflict prevention, called the ‘Dublin Action Agenda’ [www.xs4all.nlpdf Format] This ‘Agenda’ highlights four critical areas for action, including:
The need to develop a network and coalition of civil society organisations in the area of conflict prevention, and to organise a public awareness campaign on the impact of conflicts.
The need to work with governments on many levels, including strengthening national mechanisms to promote international peace and prevent conflict.
The need for serious dialogue at EU level to discuss structure reforms that will enable a more effective approach to the management of civilian crisis and longer-term peacebuilding.
The need to ensure that the UN’s capacity for conflict prevention, and interaction with civil society is strengthened at all levels – from secretariat to country teams.
ECCP expects to organise a further 14 other regional conferences over the year, with dialogue already ongoing among NGO networks in Southern, East and West Africa, the Balkans, the Caucasus, Western CIS, Central Asia, South Asia, North East Asia, the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribean, and Canada. It expects to consolidate the various action agendas into an international report to be delivered at the UN conference on civil society in 2005. The Dublin Agenda is useful in so far as it acknowledges the role NGOs can play in conflict prevention, according to Alice Hutchinson of Saferworld. It also provided “an important platform for civil society organisations – both peacebuilding and more traditional development agencies – to come together to reflect on their own approaches, and seek ways to reflect and learn lessons,” Dan Smith of International Alert added. The will to move forward These steps would appear to reflect a renewed commitment toward conflict prevention, the multilateral system and better coordination among civil society organisations, but the question is, will that be enough to shift the policy agenda? Justin Kilcullen, director of the Irish development and campaigning NGO Trócaire, suggested that many of the solutions were already in place - in the values captured in the UN Charter and institutions, international human rights instruments, and other mechanisms, but that the record to date did not suggest there was the political will to act. “The Cold War was meant to provide a peace dividend, but it hasn’t happened,” Kilcullen told the conflict prevention conference in Dublin. “Instead, there was active disengagement, as there was no longer any strategic interest in poor countries, so the West walked away.” “World leaders promised a coalition against poverty, but instead development is being sidelined in EU foreign policy. ” Hans Zomer told IRIN. “Without addressing the causes of poverty and injustice we will never be secure, and while the basic values of the EU are fantastic, there remains a huge gap between rhetoric and intentions.” On a more positive note, the fact that human security was so firmly part of the EU agenda for the Irish presidency of the EU suggests that there is a degree of political will to change, according to Saferworld. Winning the “tug of war” in favour of a culture of prevention and peace, as opposed to a reaction to crises, may still have a long way to go, but Kofi Annan’s conclusion in his 2001 report on conflict prevention may be just as relevant today: “The time has come to translate the rhetoric of conflict prevention into concrete action.”"
Thousands flee US military onslaught on Haditha,"Nearly 1,000 families have fled their homes in Haditha in western Iraq following the launch of a US-led military operation to hunt down in insurgents in the town in the Euphrates river valley, according to residents in the area. The Iraq Red Crescent Society said it had sent an evaluation mission to the town 225 km west of Baghdad to get a more precise idea of the situation and was preparing to send a convoy of relief items to the area. The combined military operation by 2,500 US and Iraqi government troops backed by warplanes began in Hadithi on Tuesday and followed on from a similar offensive against Islamic insurgents in villages near al-Qaim on the Syrian border which began on 1 October. The IRCS said earlier this week that over 900 families had abandoned their homes in the al-Qaim area, which lies further upstream in the Euphrates valley. The main hospital in al-Qaim said it had treated dozens of civilians who had been injured in crossfire between the insurgents and 1,000 US troops conducting house-to-house searches and had admitted several bodies of people who had been killed. The military operation in Haditha, code-named “River Gate,” is a much larger affair and is shaping up to be the biggest military push by US-led forces in the Anbar governorate of western Iraq so far this year. Residents in the district, which is mainly inhabited by Sunni Muslims opposed to the US-backed government in Baghdad, said people had been fleeing from Haditha and the nearby towns of Haqlaniyah and Barwana, following repeated air strikes. Those with cars headed for the capital Baghdad, while others had sought refuge in abandoned schools and had camped in improvised tents near the roadside. The offensive in Haditha took the Red Crescent by surprise at a time when most of its resources were deployed trying to help civilians hurt and displaced by the fighting in al-Qaim and an earlier US military operation to gain control of the northern town of Talafar in September. “It is a collapse and we now don’t know where to start or finish, but the IRCS will work intensively to give support for those innocent people and children who are fleeing their town trying to survive,” IRCS spokeswoman Ferdous al-Abadi said. People abandoning Haditha said they feared the US-led military operation would lead to massive damage in the town. “My wife was hurt as we ran out of our house in an exchange of fire between those inhuman US soldiers and the insurgents. Our city will be destroyed like Fallujah and it is the innocent people who will suffer as a result,” moaned Salah Kubaissy, 46, who was seeking shelter in an abandoned school. US troops went round Hadifa with loudspeakers ordering residents to stay inside their houses as they searched for insurgents building by building. “They broke into my house and started to shout at me and my wife. She was having a bath, but they just took her naked and pushed her into the kitchen, saying that if she moved she was going to die,” Shaker Hakeem, 39, another local resident, told IRIN. Medical sources said the US-led forces had arrested two doctors at the main hospital in Haditha. US troops burst in complaining that everyone there was part of the resistance, they said. “They entered our hospital without the minimum of respect to our patients and arrested many of them. Even two doctors were arrested as they were carrying out a small surgical operation,” said Haki Hadethi, a senior doctor at the hospital. He urged humanitarian organisations to send medical supplies to Haditha, saying the hospital had run out, but it was the only medical centre with the capacity to deal with situation in the entire district. US military officials say the offensives in the upper Euphrates valley are aimed at re-establishing government control in the mainly Sunni area ahead of a referendum on Iraq’s controversial new constitution on 15 October. Many Sunni Muslims oppose the new constitution, fearing they will lose power to the Shia Muslims who dominate southern Iraq and Kurds in the north. The armed resistance to the government and the US-led occupation force which backs it, draws most of its support from the Sunni community."
Military officials to discuss border tension,"Senior military officers from Ethiopia and Eritrea are to discuss tensions along their common frontier at a meeting next week in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, a UN official said on Friday. The officers will hold one-day talks on 25 November, according to UN spokeswoman Gail Bindley Taylor Sainte. The current military standoff between the two neighbours, which has been exacerbated by troop movements, had caused the situation to remain ""tense and potentially volatile"", she added. The UN, Sainte explained, hoped to use the Nairobi meeting to address international fears that a new conflict could erupt in the region. ""It is the only forum where both parties meet, so I am sure we will use that opportunity to raise all the issues on the ground,"" Sainte told reporters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. ""This will be the first time that Ethiopian and Eritrean military officials meet since we described the situation as tense and potentially volatile,"" she added. Maj Gen Rajinder Singh, the force commander of the UN peacekeepers in the region, will chair the UN-brokered talks. Last month, he cautioned that a new war could erupt if nothing was done to try and end the rising tensions. According to UN peacekeepers, large troop movements have continued on both sides of the border and restrictions imposed by Eritrea have hampered their ability to monitor the situation. Ethiopia has moved two divisions - estimated at around 12,000 men - to the border region in the last two weeks and stationed them some 40 km from the buffer zone, Sainte added. Since December, Ethiopia has deployed up to seven army divisions close to the buffer zone and ignored UN Security Council requests to withdraw them. The government insists it is a purely defensive measure in case of attack. Restrictions by local Eritrean officials on the 3,200 UN peacekeeping troops that patrol the 25-km wide buffer zone and surrounding areas have also increased in the last week. The UN mission estimated that Eritrea’s ban on helicopter flights had cut their monitoring capacity by more than half. Almost all night patrols have been curtailed, and restrictions have been placed on vehicle and foot patrols. Around 300,000 men are believed to be entrenched along the 1,000-km frontier, where both countries waged a bloody two-year war. Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year guerrilla war, but the boundary between the two East African nations was never formally demarcated. A border war that erupted in 1998 killed tens of thousands of people and cost both countries an estimated US $1 million a day. A 2000 peace agreement provided for an independent commission to rule on the boundary. Ethiopia refused to accept the panel's 2002 decision. UN peacekeeping troops now monitor a buffer zone at a cost of $189 million a year. Eritrea has said that whatever movements may have occurred on its side near the border have to do with agricultural activities. The last meeting by military officials from both sides was in September, when the UN said the peacekeepers described the situation as ""stable""."
Military coordination committee meets in Nairobi,"Eritrean military leaders have rejected assertions by the United Nations that the border with Ethiopia is ""militarily stable"", claiming instead that Eritrean territory is being occupied. Eritrean Brig-Gen Abrahaley Kifle said on Monday that he disagreed with the UN’s assessment that the situation on the 1,000-km long border remained stable. He made the statement at the UN-hosted Military Coordination Committee (MCC) talks held between Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The talks are being held inspite of Ethiopia’s rejection of the independent border commission’s ruling on the demarcation of its border with Eritrea which placed key territory in Eritrea. Demarcation was consequently suspended last year while the international community started looking for a solution to the impasse. A central point of the dispute concerns the small Ethiopian-administered town of Badme, which the border commission determined to be part of Eritrea. The MCC meetings constitute the only forum for the two countries to meet and hold face-to-face talks despite their war having ended in a peace agreement signed in Algiers three years ago. In a statement released after the Nairobi meeting, the UN said Abrahaley's assessment differed from that of the commander of the UN's peacekeeping force, Maj-Gen Robert Gordon, who was quoted as saying ""that while the atmosphere in the border areas remained politically tense"", it was militarily ""alert but defensive"". The UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) was ""generally happy with the cooperation from the Eritrean Defence Force and the Ethiopian Armed Force, as well as the Eritrean militia and police"" the statement said. It added, however, that ""there remained security incidents and issues"" which could be solved by forming local military committees between both sides on the border. UNMEE stated that the local committees – called Sector Military Coordination Commissions (SMCCs) – would be formed to help avert ""security incidents"" in the border area following mounting fears that a local flare-up on the border could escalate. At the MCC meeting, a timetable for the inception of the SMCCs was agreed, with three of them to be established respectively for the western, central and eastern regions of the border. Although the war ended in December 2000, incidents of cattle rustling, shootings by unidentified armed groups, and other incidents have alarmed the peacekeepers. Local UN commanders currently have to shuttle between the two sides to resolve disputes, but the planned system would have a standing committee that could be called at any time. UNMEE envisages Ethiopian and Eritrean local commanders meeting on neutral territories like bridges linking the two countries or UN bases. The local military meetings would then report back to the full military coordination committee attended by senior military leaders from both countries under the auspices of the UN. Ethiopian Brig-Gen Yohanes Gebremeskel told the MCC during its Nairobi meeting that his country ""wanted to avoid war at all costs"" and supported efforts to find a peaceful solution. He reiterated that Ethiopia was keen to find a ""lasting solution"" to the border demarcation, which, if reached, would benefit not only the two countries but the region as a whole. Ethiopia has called for dialogue with Eritrea to overcome the impasse over the border, but Eritrea has refused any talks until after demarcation has been effected in accordance with the commission's ruling. The next MCC meeting will take place on 15 March, also in Nairobi."
Rival military commanders make peace,"Commanders of two military regions of North and South Kivu provinces, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, agreed on Monday to stop fighting, a military spokesman said. The spokesman for the 10th Military Region based in South Kivu, Lt Kasanda Wa Kasanda, said the agreement was the result of a weeklong visit to the region by the chief of the nation's land forces, General Major (equivalent to Maj-Gen) Sylvain Buki who is still in the DRC eastern region. He is touring in the region in a bid to end clashes between the 8th and the 10th military regions. Buki summoned both brigadiers general Mbuza Mabe, commander of the 10th, and Obed Rwibasira of the 8th to the town of Minova, in North Kivu Province, on Monday to broker the agreement. Both men had refused to coordinate their military actions and had their respective forces fighting each other over control of some localities near the town of Minova in South Kivu, near the border with North Kivu. ""Some level of understanding has been reached between us. We have found a way to settle our differences in line with the wishes of the chief of staff of the ground forces, Maj-Gen Buki. The military will respect their territorial jurisdictions that lie along the provincial boundaries or North and South Kivu,"" Mabe said. The 10th Military Region had accused the 8th (Goma) of having attacked Kalehe, 70 km northeastern of Bukavu, in South Kivu, last week. Several days later soldiers of the Bukavu headquarters seized control from army dissidents Laurent Nkunda and Jules Mutebutsi. Rwibasira, Nkunda and Mutsbutsi are all members of the former rebel movement, the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie (RCD), which at one time or another during the five-year war controlled North and South Kivu. ""From now on soldiers of the 10th Military Region who will be in Minova, situated in the north of South Kivu, will be taking orders from the 10 Military Region and those who are in North Kivu will be given orders from the 8th Military Region,"" Mabe said."
Member of top US military delegation stabbed to death,"A member of the United States Government 34-man military delegation in Liberia to help set up a new national army was stabbed to death in his hotel room in the capital Monrovia, Monday, said the Liberian government on Tuesday. The killing took place at the Mamba Point Hotel in the diplomatic enclave of the city and only yards away from the US embassy. Liberia's defence ministry spokesman Moizou Kromah told reporters on Tuesday that the incident occurred during the early hours of Monday morning in one of the bedrooms of the hotel where the deceased and the rest of the US delegation were lodging. No official motive has been given by authorities. The identity of the murdered man has not been established, but the Liberian government has confirmed that the man was a civilian member of the US team. ""We have learnt that the individual murdered in cold blood was one of the four civilians on the delegation...the identity of the deceased will be withheld pending the conclusion of an investigation,"" Kromah disclosed. He said the team, which arrived in Monrovia on 19 May, composed of 30 senior military officers of US Military Command and four civilians, was on an assessment mission to assist in the creation of a new Liberian army following 14 years of bloody civil war, brought to an end in August. Sources close to the Liberian state security told IRIN on Tuesday that the deceased was stabbed to death in his hotel room by an unknown murderer or murderers who entered via a ceiling cavity shared with an adjoining room. Cash and other valuables were missing from the room, they said. ""Because of the embarrassing nature of such a murder of a US citizen in Liberia, the transitional government chairman Gyude Bryant has ordered all of the state security including the police, national bureau of investigation, national security agency [Liberia's intelligence bureau] to investigate the killing and arrest the culprits,"" one of the sources said. Expatriates and western visitors lodge at the Mamba Point Hotel, because of its proximity to the US and European Union embassies as well as the offices of various UN agencies. Plain cloths Liberian security officers have tightened security at the hotel, replacing the private security agents who operated before the murder to clients’ satisfaction. Frequent visitors to the Mamba Point Hotel, which operated throughout the Liberian civil war, chose the hotel as it usually had electricity and water, a luxury in Monrovia and was located near the sea - an emergency exit in case of troubles. Shock and anger gripped residents of the capital, Monrovia as news of the murder spread. ""No body should overlook this killing, because it has a propensity to indicate to the international community that Liberia is still not safe,"" said Daniel Johnson, a student of international relations. Liberian police officers in collaboration with armed UN police have stepped up patrols in and around the city. A senior police officer said: ""We will search for those responsible and bring them to justice."""
"Rebels willing to negotiate peace, but only with ethnic leaders","The Libération du peuple Hutu-front national de libération (FNL), Burundi's last remaining rebel group, said on Wednesday it did not recognise the legitimacy of the new government and would only negotiate peace with representatives of the country's three ethnic groups. ""The FNL is willing to negotiate,"" Pasteur Habimana, the FNL spokesman, said from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. He said, however, that the international community would have to act as guarantor during such negotiations which would have to be with the representatives of the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa ethnic groups. Habimana said even if the FNL's demands were not met it would not restart the war. ""The armed conflict is now over,"" he said. He denied that the FNL still was initiating strikes against the army. ""We are now just defending ourselves against attacks by the army,"" he said. The army blames the FNL for sporadic fighting before and after the presidential elections in August. On Tuesday, army spokesman Maj Adolphe Manirakiza said that last week the FNL had attacked several locations around the nation's capital, Bujumbura, killing one person and wounding another. On Wednesday, the governor of the northern province of Bubanza, Nzobonimpa Manassé, said the FNL rebels had been fighting government troops there since Saturday. Despite the FNL's refusal to recognise the government, Burundi's newly elected president, Pierre Nkurunziza, said on Saturday that his government would do its utmost to negotiate peace with the rebel movement. ""We will set up a government commission in the near future, comprising four army officers and four political leaders, which will prepare negotiations as soon as possible,"" he said. However, Habimana said the FNL would not negotiate with any team representing the new government, as ""the elections were not conducted in compliance with the 2002 Arusha peace agreement."" He also said the FNL was not in contact with any leading government officials or with any of the opposition parties. ""We are the only group in Burundi that still believes in truth and justice,"" he said. Local political commentators said the FNL was taking an isolationist, hardline position so that when the group eventually negotiates it could do so from a position of strength. ""By saying the new government is illegitimate, the FNL wants to be considered on the same footing as the government,"" Pancrace Cimpaye, the former government's spokesman, said. The special representative of the UN Secretary-General in Burundi, Carolyn McAskie, who has held numerous talks with FNL leaders, expressed frustration last week with the movement's go-slow approach to peace. UN News reported on Wednesday that a group of regional leaders from neighbouring countries have met with the UN Secretary-General and international donors in New York at the World Summit, which began on Monday, to request support to Burundi's new government in its efforts to include the FNL in the peace process. The group also called on the FNL ""to cease hostilities immediately"". A less radical wing of the FNL may be forming under the leadership of the group’s vice-chairman, Jean Bosco Sindayigaya. Last week, he called for a more conciliatory approach to peace negotiations with the government. ""There is no more reason to continue fighting as the injustice to the Hutu people is being settled,"" he said on local radio."
"Winning the legislature, former rebels vow to negotiate peace","One of the former rebel groups during Burundi’s recent civil war has won most of the votes in the legislative elections and pledged on Wednesday to enter into talks with the sole rebel force still fighting the government, the Forces nationales de liberation (FNL) led by Agathon Rwasa. ""We will negotiate immediately with the Palipehutu-FNL,"" Jeremie Ngendakumana, spokesman for the winning Conseil National pour la défense de la démocratie-Forces pour la défense de la démocratie (CNDD-FDD) party of Pierre Nkurunziza, said in Bujumbura. ""The CNDD-FDD had previously been in the bush then agreed to take part in the government; now the FNL could do the same,"" Ngendakumana said. Provisional results announced on Wednesday by the chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Paul Ngarambe, show that the CNDD-FDD won between 60 percent and 70 percent of the vote. The party of current President Domitien Ndayizeye, the Front pour la démocratie au Burundi, or FRODEBU, came second followed by the Parti de unite pour le progres national, or UPRONA. Ngarambe said the CNDD faction led by Léonard Nyangoma came fourth and the Movement pour la restoration de lacitoyenneté, fifth. The FNL did not take part in Monday's elections. However, unlike municipal elections in June, its combatants did not attack voting stations, the Collective of Human Rights Associations said on Wednesday. The collective also called on FNL leaders to continue to negotiate with the government. The FNL signed a ceasefire agreement on 15 May in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, but its fighters have been accused of continuing to mount attacks, mostly in the province around Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura FNL spokesman Pasteur Habimana told a local radio station on Wednesday that his group had ""deep concerns"" about the Dar es Salam agreement because government troops were attacking FNL positions. Habimana also expressed ambivalence about Monday’s elections. ""We are accustomed to seeing parties win elections but not respecting the law,"" he said. A representative of the party of former Burundian President Jean Baptiste Bagaza, the Parti pour le redressement national, Zenon Nimubona, said Monday’s elections were ""peppered with fraud"". That, he added, was the reason his party was unlikely to win a parliamentary seat. The Coallition de la Societé civile pour le Supervision des élections-COSOME, a poll monitoring group, said there were some irregularities but that overall the elections were fair. Senatorial elections are due on 29 July. Then on 19 August, the newly-elected senators, together with the newly-elected assemblymen, will choose the country's new head of state."
Germany donates office equipment,"The Federal Republic of Germany has donated office equipment worth US $20,000 to the Central African Republic's follow-up committee for the National Dialogue, Peter-Eduard Weistabel, Head of Mission of the German Embassy in Yaounde (Cameroon), said on Sunday. ""The equipment we donated should help the follow-up committee of the national dialogue to perform its duties,"" Weistabel said in the CAR capital, Bangui. He added the committee would receive all the equipment, which includes computers, printers, floppy diskettes, video equipment, photocopy machines and ink cartridges, by August. The chairperson of the follow-up committee, Catherine Samba-Panza, said the donation was testament to the consistent interest the German government had shown for the consolidation of peace and democracy in CAR. ""The donation will reinforce the committee's capacity to explain, inform and sensitise [the public] on the important recommendations of the national dialogue,"" she said. CAR held the national dialogue on reconciliation in September-October 2003, with the participation of all stakeholders in the country's political development, who included former presidents Andre Kolingba, the late David Dacko, representatives of political parties, civil society, military, labour unions, NGOs, youth and religious associations. A committee was formed at the end of the talks to oversee the implementation of the recommendations made at the end of the dialogue. This German donation marks the first external aid to the committee."
McAskie urges new political leaders to negotiate peace with FNL rebels,"The head of the UN Mission in Burundi, Carolyn McAskie, called on politicians on Monday to negotiate a ceasefire with the country's remaining rebel group, the Palipehutu-FNL of Agaton Rwasa, ir order to finalise the current peace process. McAskie was speaking in Bujumbura, the capital, during the last review of the transitional government and parliament, by the Implementation and Monitoring Committee of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi, which she chairs. The FNL is not among the 19 parties to the accord and has recently expanded its armed operations outside Bujumbura Rural Province. She, who is also the Special Representative of UN Secretary-General to Burundi, called on the FNL to engage in sincere negotiations for a permanent and lasting ceasefire. She told politicians that the peace process should continue beyond elections and that the new government should finalise reforms in the security services, on land issues as well as undertake refugee repatriation."
Germany gives $61.7m for development projects,"Kenya is to receive 50 million Euros (US $61.7 million) to promote agriculture, water and the health sector from the German government following an agreement signed on Tuesday by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and President Mwai Kibaki in the capital, Nairobi. The funds will be disbursed in the form of technical cooperation grants and low-interest loans over the next two years. Schroeder, who is on an official visit to Kenya, told journalists in Nairobi that his government was keen to intensify cooperation with Kenya following the country's peaceful political transition in December 2002. This is Germany's first major financial support to Kenya since bilateral relations between the two countries declined in 1992, after Germany cited deficiencies in good governance on the part of the Kenyan authorities. Schroeder hailed Kenya's political and economic reform efforts, and pledged his government's support to the country's ongoing economic reconstruction. ""We welcome the important step taken by the Kenyan government in the field of primary education and the fight against corruption,"" Schroeder said. He also recognised recent efforts by the Kenyan government to promote regional peace, notably in Somalia and Sudan as well as fighting international terrorism. ""Germany will make available its knowledge and means to help the regional fight against terrorism and organised crime,"" Schroeder said. The German leader's visit is part of a four-nation African tour that also takes him to Ethiopia, South Africa and Ghana."
Germany's Herero reconciliation efforts rebuffed,"The signing of an agreement between the Namibian and German governments concerning reparations for colonial rule is on hold until the various communities who suffered during that era have been consulted. The deal would have brought Euro 20 million (US $23.5 million) into development projects in the southern African country. President Hifikepunye Pohamba, who ended a five-day state visit to Germany on Friday, told Germany's development cooperation minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, earlier this week that the agreement could not be finalised until the affected Herero, Nama and Damara groups were consulted. Neither side explained why consultations with these groups had not taken place prior to the meeting in Berlin. ""I regret this, because the content of the agreement was known to the Namibian government and they agreed to it,"" Wieczorek-Zeul told reporters. The agreement would have pumped money into development projects aimed at benefiting the affected groups between 2006 and 2016. Wieczorek-Zeul made history last year when he asked for ""forgiveness"" for colonial atrocities committed a century ago against Herero-speaking Namibians as well as the Nama- and Damara-speaking tribes. In Namibia the ""Herero Genocide Committee 1904"" lambasted the German government on Thursday for proposing a reconciliation initiative without extensive consultations. Edwin Kanguatjivi, spokesperson for the committee, told reporters the German government had not embarked on a dialogue with them since the Wieczorek-Zeul apology in August 2004. ""The Herero people shall not be fooled by hypocritical apologies, nor shall they allow their leaders to be treated as minors,"" said Kanguatjivi. In September 2001 the Herero filed a civil claim in the district court of Columbia in the United States demanding $2 billion from the German government for atrocities committed during colonial rule. The lawsuit lodged by the Herero People's Reparation Corporation also seeks $2 billion from three German companies - Deutsche Bank; mining company Terex Corporation, formerly Orenstein-Koppel Co.; and the shipping company, Deutsche Afrika Linie, formerly Woermann Linie. The district court of Columbia was chosen for the lawsuit because a 216-year-old American law, the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789, allows such civil action to be taken. Germany and Namibia will discuss the extension of bilateral development cooperation for 2006 and 2007 next week in the capital, Windhoek. President Hifikepunye Pohamba, who ended a five-day state visit to Germany on Friday, told Germany's development cooperation minister, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, earlier this week that the agreement could not be finalised until the affected Herero, Nama and Damara groups were consulted.

Increased AIDS support promised by Germany,"Germany has announced plans to boost programmes aimed at tackling HIV/AIDS in developing countries. According to German Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, her country was committed to the Millennium Development Goal of curbing the spread of HIV by 2015 and anti-AIDS programmes were already showing results in several regions. Germany's Deutsche Welle news service quoted Wieczorek-Zeul as saying: ""With treatment, lives are being prolonged, so that children have their parents with them for longer and HIV-positive people can lead longer, fuller lives."" The country is the third largest anti-AIDS donor, after the USA and UK, and currently contributes more than $387 million annually."
British millions pledged for AIDS battle,"Britain's international development secretary Hilary Benn has announced funding of close to US $214 million over the next four years to tackle HIV/AIDS around the world. The new funding will also aim to improve sexual and reproductive health for women and young people in developing countries. The UK's Press Association quoted Benn as saying: ""Sexual and reproductive health and AIDS are inextricably linked. By taking on one, we know we are also helping to tackle the other. Far too many poor women in developing countries live with painful, disabling, and hidden injuries or illness because they are denied their rights to sexual and reproductive health."" Approximately $66 million of the funds go to UNAIDS to pay for its role in leading the global HIV/AIDS effort and coordinating international donations, while some $147 million has been allocated to the UN Population Fund over four years."
IMF negotiations continue,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to continue negotiations with the Zimbabwean government on economic reforms to get the country back on track. IMF spokeswoman Gita Bhatt told IRIN on Tuesday that the Fund's mission to Zimbabwe had been extended, and that ""the team is likely to stay on until Friday in order to finish a report to management ahead of the board meeting on 9 September"". Zimbabwe was suspended from the IMF and faces expulsion for non-payment of arrears when the executive board meets. Bhatt said the staff mission currently in Harare would ""update information on recent economic developments, as well as on policy initiatives that the authorities plan to implement in the period ahead"". Zimbabwe has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since February 2001, and about US $295 million was outstanding at 22 August. The IMF's executive board extended a lifeline on 16 February this year, when it postponed its deliberations on Zimbabwe's ""compulsory withdrawal"" from the Fund for six months. However, to unlock potential foreign aid the country had to strengthen its cooperation with the IMF - something that had yet to happen, said Zimbabwean economist John Robertson. ""The IMF is clearly looking to persuade the country to adopt policies that will allow Zimbabwe to pay its arrears - it has got to recover the ability to earn foreign currency. The IMF cannot lend to any country that shows the lack of ability to repay the money,"" Robertson pointed out. ""The policies that have got us into the difficulties we now face; policies that have destroyed our ability to earn foreign currency - such as the [fast-track] land redistribution programme that wiped out the tobacco and beef export industries - are the things the IMF want to see us fix before they lend us any more money,"" he explained. After a staff team visited Zimbabwe in June, the IMF noted that ""the magnitude of the economic problems confronting Zimbabwe calls for a comprehensive policy package that should include decisive action to lower the fiscal deficit, a tightening of monetary policy, and steps to establish a unified, market-determined exchange rate. The package should also include structural reforms, such as the removal of administrative controls, to ease shortages and restore private-sector confidence"". Although the Fund stipulated that ""a rebuilding of relations with the international community"" was a critical part of the effort to reverse the economic decline, Robertson noted that the government appeared to be moving towards a more ""isolationist policy"", which could see its international relations deteriorate."
China donates US $4 million equipment,"The People's Republic of China has donated equipment worth US $4 million to the Central African Republic (CAR), state-owned Radio Centrafrique reported on Tuesday. Chinese Ambassador El Si Ji made the donation, comprising 20,000 corrugated iron sheets, 110 computers, 3,000 bicycles and 60 mt of office furniture, on behalf of his government during a ceremony on Monday in the capital, Bangui. The iron sheets will be used to rebuild military barracks while the CAR transitional government will use the computers, bicycles and office furniture during general elections planned for early 2005. ""China is following closely the development of the transition in CAR and rejoices that encouraging results are being obtained,"" El Si Ji, was quoted as saying. He added that China would continue to support CAR during its transition. The minister for international cooperation, Daniel Nditifei-Boissembe, received the donation on behalf of the CAR government. ""CAR has experienced hardships and it will remain grateful to China for its constant material and financial assistance,"" he said. China was the first country to assist CAR following a 15 March 2003 coup by former armed forces chief of staff, Francois Bozize, who overthrew President Ange-Felix Patasse after a six-month rebellion. On 11 March 2004, China granted the CAR a $ 2-million interest-free loan to help the government pay salary arrears owed to civil servants."
Germany grants Bujumbura 9.5 million euros to fight poverty,"Germany has granted Burundi 9.5 million euros (US $11.1 million) for a one-year programme aimed at reducing poverty across the country by providing safe drinking water, fighting HIV/AIDS and promoting peace and reconciliation, a German government official said on Wednesday in Berlin. The spokeswoman at the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, Barbara Wieland, said the grant would cover the period from December 2005 to December 2006 and would prioritise water projects. She said Germany would support reforms in Burundi's judiciary, conflict prevention and human rights programmes in an effort to promote peace and reconciliation in the country that is recovering from 12 years of civil war. ""The [grant] renewal for 2007 can be negotiated in 2006,"" Wieland said. She added that Wednesday's grant would be disbursed in phases, with the first phase paid in December. The latest grant follows another of 17 million euros ($19.9 million) Germany gave Burundi in November when it officially resumed cooperation with the central African nation. The grants follow positive political developments in Burundi. In September, the country completed its transition to democracy with the election of a new president, Pierre Nkurunziza, whose policies have been widely welcomed by Burundi's development partners. Germany had suspended its cooperation with Burundi in 1993 following the outbreak of civil war. ""Nkurunziza has sent all the positive signals that the donors were expecting from him including a free and fair election, his woman-friendly government and his priorities policies of education and reconciliation"", Amadeu Altafaj, the EU spokesman told IRIN on Tuesday from Brussels, where Nkurunziza was on a four-day official visit."
Top rebel negotiator surrenders to government,"The principal negotiator for the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in protracted talks with the Ugandan government, Sam Kolo, gave himself up on Wednesday, an army spokesman said. ""He has surrendered and our commanders evacuated him,"" Maj Shaban Bantariza, the spokesman for the Ugandan army, told IRIN. According to Bantariza, Kolo's surrender came as a result of a disagreement with the head of the LRA, Joseph Kony, who subsequently issued an order for his execution. ""He had no choice because Kony had ordered for his execution for defying orders to get out of northern Uganda and return to Sudan,"" Bantariza said on Thursday. The LRA's chief spokesman since 1999, Kolo, a Brigadier in the rebel ranks, became the highest-ranking LRA rebel commander to give himself up to the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF). At least three other LRA commanders have surrendered or been captured by government forces over the year. Kolo had been a member of the LRA for several years, waging war in northern Uganda in a bid to overthrow the government of Yoweri Museveni, ostensibly to replace it with a government based on the biblical Ten Commandments. Hesitant to talk about the implications of Kolo's surrender for the ongoing talks, Betty Bigombe, the chief mediator, told IRIN: ""The final objective is to end the war - it will take us time to know how this will affect the peace process, but of course it is a setback."" Bigombe said she had received a phone call from Vincent Otti, Kony's deputy, telling her that he would replace Kolo as the LRA's chief negotiator. The head of the government team to the peace talks, who is also the Ugandan internal affairs minister, Ruhakana Rugunda, told IRIN that he was confident Kolo's surrender would not affect the peace process. ""Kolo's surrender will not affect the fact that the door for negotiations for peace will still be open,"" Rugunda said. Religious leaders from northern Uganda, who have been at the forefront of the peace talks, said they were concerned about the fate of the negotiations following Kolo's surrender. ""His surrender leaves a situation of uncertainty as to what will be the future of the peace process,"" John Baptist Odama, Catholic Archbishop of Northern Uganda, told IRIN on Wednesday. The government and the LRA have fought a 19-year-old war, but since last December, have been involved in intense negotiations to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. The LRA, notorious for their brutality, have abducted as many as 20,000 children to serve as soldiers or sex slaves of the commanders. The northern conflict has seen tens of thousands killed and an estimated 1.6 million people displaced from their homes. On Tuesday, the Ugandan defence minister, Amama Mbabazi, said the LRA, which once had thousands of fighters in its ranks, had been reduced to a meagre force of 300 to 400 fighters and predicted ""certain victory"" for the UPDF."
Cabinda separatists merge to negotiate with government,"Separatists waging a low-intensity struggle against Angolan troops for control of oil-rich Cabinda have merged in a bid to engage the authorities in dialogue over the future status of the troubled province. The Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave (FLEC) and the Front for the Liberation of the Cabinda Enclave-Cabinda Armed Forces (FLEC-FAC) would now be known as FLEC. The leadership of the new organisation would be drawn from members of the two former rebel groups, a senior rebel leader told IRIN on Wednesday. The two factions have been battling the central Angolan government since the country achieved independence in 1975. They claim the province has its own distinct and separate identity, history and culture, and that it was illegally occupied. ""Our decision to merge was based on a request from ordinary Cabindans, civil society and the church. They made it clear that it would be preferable to negotiate with the government under a single banner,"" FLEC politburo member, Antonio Mbemba, told IRIN on Wednesday. ""Our first step is to set up a commission that will decide how to approach the government in Luanda [the Angolan capital]. The government has claimed that because of the fragmentation, there was no valid interlocutor with which it could negotiate. But now they have no excuse,"" he added. Discussions between the government and leaders of FLEC's various factions have so far been limited, and without tangible results. ""The last time we had any contact was in Paris in 2003 and these were merely exploratory talks,"" Mbemba pointed out. Despite the defection of several key officials to Angola's ruling MPLA last year, he said FLEC remained ""strong and committed"" to fighting for the self-determination of the people of Cabinda. Father Raul Tati, a leading cleric and civil rights activist in the province, told IRIN he hoped the merger would signal to the authorities that the separatists were serious about negotiations. Sporadic clashes between the rebels and Angolan armed forces in the countryside over the past two years have caught the attention of the international community. On a recent visit to the province, the UN Special Representative for Human Rights Defenders, Hina Jilani, raised concern over the high number of government troops in the enclave, commenting that human rights violations continued to occur because of the close proximity of the military to civilian populations. An ad-hoc commission for human rights in Cabinda published a report in November last year detailing accounts of violence, abuse, torture, summary killings, rape and illegal detentions against the civilian population."
"Negotiations to allow observers at final vote count ""positive""","The European Union (EU) on Tuesday said negotiations with Mozambique's electoral commission to open up the one remaining part of the counting process in upcoming general elections to observers were progressing well. An EU official told IRIN the talks were ""positive"" and were moving in the ""right direction"". ""We have been engaged in ongoing dialogue with the electoral commission and we expect a resolution,"" he said. While election monitors may be present at counting stations at the local level, they are excluded from the final provincial and national stages of the count. The final tabulation is seen as crucial, because itis at this stage that spoiled ballot papers are considered, and both provincial and national elections commissions make decisions about polling station results sheets. According to the National Election Commission (CNE) the country's electoral laws prohibits the inclusion of monitors during the final deliberations, but analysts point out that the electoral law does not mention the issue. CNE spokesman Felipe Mandlate said: ""We cannot ignore electoral laws and we expect international observers and the press to respect these."" In a statement on Friday the EU urged the CNE to allow observers access to ""all relevant stages of the election process, including tabulating results at all levels"". ""It is essential that the mission is allowed to carry out its mandate, in line with international standards and practice in this field,"" said EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten, adding that he trusted the issue could be resolved in time for the 1-2 December poll."
France loans Bangui US $1.3 million,"France will loan the Central African Republic (CAR) US $1.3 million, French President Jacques Chirac's special adviser on African affairs, Michel de Bonnecorse, announced on Sunday. State-owned Radio Centrafrique reported that De Bonnecorse made the announcement at the end of a two-day visit to Bangui, the CAR capital, where he held talks with senior government officials including CAR leader Francois Bozize. The radio quoted De Bonnecorse as saying that the loan was part of France's efforts to see the CAR through its transitional period, scheduled to end in early 2005 with the holding of democratic elections. ""Of course, one million three hundred dollars is not a big amount, I'm sure the Finance Minister had hoped for a greater amount, but it is a heartfelt gift,"" De Bonnecorse was quoted as saying. ""It is ready money immediately distributed in the economic circuit."" The French loan follows a $2-million interest-free loan granted to the CAR by China on 11 March. It also came just as the CAR completed paying November 2003 salaries for civil servants. The government has promised to begin paying December salaries from Monday."
Taiwanese aid flows in after links with China cut,"Burkina Faso continues to reap the financial rewards of cutting diplomatic relations with China 10 years ago in order to establish links with Taiwan instead. The two countries signed an agreement on Thursday that provides for Taiwan to grant the West African country nearly US$14 million for water supply, irrigation and rural development projects over the next three years. Most of the money will be used to sink 1,000 boreholes to provide clean drinking water in villages and build 25 reservoirs to improve irrigation in rural areas. The remainder will be used to improve the roads in five provincial towns. Burkina Faso broke off diplomatic relations with China in 1994 and established formal ties with Taiwan instead. Since then it has received a steady flow of aid from the island state, which China regards as a renegade province of its own territory. The latest $14 million aid agreement on Thursday represents the first tranche of a $32.5 million Taiwanese aid package agreed last year to cover the period 2004-2006."
Negotiations needed to avoid war in the east - ICG,"Negotiations are needed immediately to address a simmering conflict in eastern Sudan and avoid the outbreak of a new regional war, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG). In a report, ""Sudan: Saving the Peace in the East"", the advocacy organisation said that if the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) - now part of the Sudanese government - went ahead with a troop withdrawal scheduled in the east, the low-intensity conflict there risked becoming a major new war with disastrous humanitarian consequences. The troop withdrawal is part of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement, or “CPA”, signed by Sudan’s ruling National Congress Party and the then rebel SPLM almost a year ago. The agreement ended a 21 year civil war in southern Sudan, but did not address the political and economic grievances of rebel groups in either eastern Sudan or the Sudanese western region of Darfur. ""Like Darfur, we have a peace agreement which falls short of providing fair wealth and power-sharing to other areas in northern Sudan,"" said David Mozersky, senior Sudan analyst for the ICG, at a press briefing in Nairobi on Thursday. Under the terms of the agreement, the SPLM is obliged to withdraw its forces from eastern Sudan by 9 January 2006. Mozersky said the SPLM was far behind schedule, expecting to withdraw 50 percent of its forces from the east by the end of March, and complete the pull-out only in October 2006. ""Given that SPLM was much more implicated [in the war] in the east than it was in Darfur, a new conflict there has the potential to unravel the CPA and draw the SPLM back into the conflict,"" Mozersky warned. According to the ICG’s new report, the SPLM ""has a duty to ensure that its withdrawal from eastern Sudan does not create a security vacuum that could invite escalation."" The main concern, Mozersky said, was how the rest of the Sudanese government would react to the SPLM pull-out, and to the possibility of more rebel attacks. ""Will they target civilians? The government has shown such viciousness in Darfur, in the Nuba Mountains and in the south, that you have to expect the worst,"" Mozersky said. Eastern Sudan is a strategic region, including Sudan’s economic lifeline to the outside world, Port Sudan, and its oil pipeline, as well as irrigated agricultural schemes and a long border with Eritrea, with whom Sudan has poor relations. The Sudanese government has a heavy security presence in the east, involving, according to ICG, three times as many forces as in the troubled region of Darfur. The rebel Eastern Front is an alliance between two rebel movements, the Beja Congress and a smaller group, the Rashaida Free Lions. It has been active in an impoverished region near the Eritrean border, but fighting is sporadic and on a small scale. ""It is unclear whether the rebels can do much more than small hit-and-run attacks, especially as the SPLM provided the bulk of the forces in the east,” Mozersky said…”But they can do substantial damage to the port, the oil pipeline and other vital infrastructure."" The SPLM needed to use its leverage as a member of the government of national unity, to start comprehensive negotiations, the ICG report stated. The international community needed to work closely with key regional actors, particularly Eritrea. The ICG also said significant donor attention and resources were needed in eastern Sudan to reverse crude mortality rates and malnutrition levels that were even higher than in Darfur. The eastern rebels accuse the government of marginalising remote regions of the country like their own. They see the year-old peace agreement between the government and the SPLM as a model for a political settlement for their own region. In a flare-up of violence in January 2005, Sudanese security forces crushed a demonstration of local Beja people in Port Sudan, killing over 20 people and wounding hundreds. More than 150 members of a political movement, the Beja Congress, were detained. Mozersky said many Beja youths had joined the movement after this, and that the Beja Congress was now mobilised in a way it had not been in the past. Originally a nomadic people, many Beja live in extensive shantytowns on the outskirts of Port Sudan. They moved to the port to work as labourers in the 1980s, after a famine killed their cattle and mechanised farming took over their land."
France tinkers with its African troop deployment,"Adjusting to new realities on the ground, France plans to re-deploy its thousands of African-based troops in a scheme it says will bolster the continent's own home-grown peacekeeping forces. The French Defence Ministry said this month it would reshuffle the deployment of some 7,000 soldiers to fit in with the way the African Union (AU) has divided up the continent into geographical zones. ""This is a very important shift which corresponds to changes made by the Africans themselves, since the AU intends to organise itself into sub-regions,"" defence spokesman Jean-Francois Bureau told a press conference in Paris. However, some analysts say that while the shift may deflect charges of neo-colonialism, France still has a long way to go before relinquishing a military toehold in Africa. ""France would never have been a big power in 1960 if it hadn't been for its presence in Africa,"" said Jean-Pierre Dozon, research director at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in Paris, referring to the year that saw colonies wrest their independence from France. With French economic and military presence strong to this day across the continent, Paris, which has one of the five permanent seats on the Security Council, can traditionally count on a block of supporting votes at the United Nations. But in recent years domestic distaste has risen over their presence in Africa, and military costs have grown as more French troops have been deployed to places like the Balkans. In response, successive governments have cut back military contingents in Africa by a third in the last decade and soldiers are rotated more quickly than in the past. Even today, more than 40 years after the independence struggles, losing influence in Africa means losing leverage on the world stage, according to Antoine Glaser, editor of the confidential Paris-based newsletter on Africa, La Lettre du Continent. But France can no longer afford the presence it once enjoyed, he said. Cote d'Ivoire stirs bad memories With an annual price tag almost 200 million euros ($240 million), most of it shouldered by the French taxpayer, the former colonial power's operations in warring Cote d'Ivoire -- where some 4,000 troops work alongside UN peacekeepers -- have highlighted the financial burden of keeping a strong military presence in Africa. ""The proposed changes are meant to bring about substantial savings,"" Glaser said.

According to the authorities, the upcoming realignment is geared at boosting cooperation with the AU, which hopes to set up an African Standby Force (ASF) of up to 25,000 men able to carry out peacekeeping missions by 2010. The ASF would consist of five brigades, one for each sub-region, and would include police and civilian elements. Recent events on the ground may also explain why France seems keen to disengage, analysts say. The most serious incident occurred last November when French troops in Cote d'Ivoire were briefly dragged into the war there after coming under attack from government troops. When nine of its peacekeepers were killed, France took out virtually the entire Ivorian air force but then had to rescue and help evacuate thousands of French nationals forced to flee ensuing anti-foreigner violence. The troubles in Cote d'Ivoire stirred up painful memories of civilian evacuations from Algeria more than 40 years ago, EHESS research director Dozon told IRIN. ""The first instinct for the average French person was to ask 'What are we doing over there?'"" he said. ""People didn't want to relive that in 2004."" More generally, African populations, especially young people, have an increasingly negative view of any French military presence in their countries, according to Gilles Yabi, a West Africa analyst with the international think tank, Crisis Group. ""As long as there are permanent bases, the suspicion will be there that these troops serve to prop up administrations, which are friendly to the French but which are not necessarily democratic,"" Yabi told IRIN from his office in Dakar. But even with the reshuffle, France is still the only former colonial power to have maintained permanent bases in Africa. Analysts say this means France will remain uniquely qualified to supply rapid response support on a continent which, despite providing about 30 percent of UN forces worldwide, can still benefit from some peacekeeping know-how. ""AU forces still don't have all the necessary skills and resources to carry out difficult missions,"" Yabi said. ""They need training and logistical support."" Ideal provider? Outside intervention can provide key resources for non-UN peacekeeping missions, according to Mark Malan, head of research at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, which was opened in Accra in 2004 to increase the sub-region's ability to handle conflicts. He pointed to Burundi, Liberia and Cote-d'Ivoire as examples of hotspots where a foreign power -- South Africa, the United States and France respectively -- played an essential role before the UN became involved. ""But who the ideal provider is? That's debatable,"" he told IRIN. Dozon of the EHESS said the way forward was for the European Union to take over from France. He welcomed talk from the French of ""Europeanising"" bases by encouraging a greater presence of EU military personnel and non-governmental organisations. By pooling resources with the EU, France would be able to save money and defend itself better against charges of neo-colonialism, he said.

Under the French plan, to be unveiled at December's Franco-African summit in Bamako, troops currently based in five French-speaking countries -- Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Gabon, Chad and Djibouti -- would be regrouped into three African bases that conform with three AU sub-regions, Senegal for West Africa, Gabon for Central Africa and Djibouti for Eastern Africa. Soldiers stationed on the French island of Reunion, which lies in the Indian Ocean, would be lined up to work with the Southern Africa sub-region. Thus troops currently based in Chad would operate out of Gabon and those serving alongside UN peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire would be withdrawn to Senegal once peace has returned. French officials said the number of troops on the ground and existing defence agreements with individual countries would not be affected. But Glaser, the editor of the Africa newsletter, said France was not relinquishing an inch of power. ""It's a change in political rhetoric but, for the time being, it doesn't change a thing on the ground,"" he said. ""French President Jacques Chirac will continue to decide all alone on whether or not France intervenes in a given country."""
Expectation of aid as president visits France,"A stronger flow of development aid from France to the Comoros is anticipated as the coup-prone Indian Ocean island settles down after years of political instability. President Azali Assoumani arrived in Paris on Monday on the first official visit by a Comoran leader since the country's independence in 1975. His tour is expected to mend relations between the island nation and the former colonial power, which cooled in 1999, the year Assoumani came to power in one of the islands' numerous coups. Since then the archipelago has held presidential and legislative elections, leading to the establishment of a federal government of the Union of the Comoros in 2004. ""The political situation has improved considerably, and now it is time for economic recovery. France is willing to help the Comoros become integrated into international activities because the political climate is good,"" a senior French diplomat in the Comoran capital, Moroni, told IRIN. French aid to the Comoros plunged from US $19.5 million to around $5.2 million per year after Assoumani took power. ""The lack of aid has meant that many sectors have suffered. Public health services are especially in need of much assistance, and government is intending to use any additional aid to improve this sector,"" said Bacar Salim, the Comoran charge d'affaires in South Africa. Salim noted that Azali's visit was part of a broader government campaign to encourage international donors and investors to return to the island country. ""Access to credit from the International Monetary Fund and other organisations has been very limited and, now that our constitutional problems are over, we are looking to hold a donors' conference towards the end of the year,"" he explained. France has said that it was still unclear by how much aid would be increased, adding that its contribution would complement the existing efforts of NGOs and other development agencies."
"One month after earthquake and 500,000 still without shelter","One month after the earthquake that devastated northern Pakistan and has killed at least 73,000, some half a million people are still without shelter. For the aid agencies it has become a race against time to reach remote mountain villages with shelter kits and tents before the bitter Himalayan winter descends. If snow falls before aid gets to survivors, Pakistan could be facing another humanitarian crisis with thousands of deaths. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Tuesday the UN Flash Appeal is currently just 15 percent funded, with USD $85 million of $550 million committed. In addition there are $49 million in unconfirmed pledges, which if confirmed, will bring the total response to 24 percent. UN agencies and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have forecast a current shortfall of $42.4 million needed to carry out the most immediate life-saving activities during the month of November alone, without which many programmes will have to close. Funding is desperately needed for shelter, camp management, logistics and early recovery. Some 3.5 million people were affected by the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, across an area of 30,000 sq km. Most hospitals, schools and government buildings were destroyed. Landslides have blocked roads, rockslides are a constant danger and villages perched high on isolated mountain ranges and deep in remote valleys mean hundreds of thousands of survivors have still not received aid. The IOM says the emergency shelter situation has improved, with tents donated by the international humanitarian community totalling some 132,000 and an additional 241,000 provided by the Pakistani government. But the IOM says even survivors with tents are still in danger, as the equipment must be winterised and able to withstand the harsh onslaught of rain, wind and snow. The IOM is also trying to distribute shelter repair kits, which allow people to salvage the remains of their homes. For residents of villages above 1,524 metres this is lifesaving equipment as many of their settlements will become cut off and inaccessible in the coming weeks as the winter snows arrive. “Getting shelter up to the mountains and gearing up to deliver shelter is a top priority as the roads are cut and this is the high-risk area,” said Annika Timonen, IOM Emergency Coordinator. The IOM and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) have planned Operation Winter Race, a programme aiming to deliver 10,000 shelter repair kits to highland villages before the worst of the winter. But it is not only survivors in remote mountain valleys who are without shelter. One month on, many survivors in the city of Muzaffarabad, the destroyed capital of Pakistani Kashmir, have still not received tents. Tariq Eqbal, a civil engineer, has been sleeping next to the ruins of his house in the Bagh area of Muzaffarabad. Once home to government workers and wealthy residents, all that remains now is a tangle of devastation, with rubble blocking the streets. “We’ve no tent and there’s not enough drinking water,” said Eqbal. “We have to travel 5 km to a mountain spring for water.” Eqbal lost his mother in the earthquake and many of his neighbours were buried beneath their collapsed homes. Mounds of crumbled ruins are all that remain of most of Muzaffarabad, and in the town centre the smell of dead bodies still hangs thick in the air. “We know that there is a family buried under there,” said Imran Alishah, a stallholder in the city’s Medina market. “I know they were sleeping above their stall when the earthquake struck, but how can we get them out?” he said, holding a scarf to his nose to block the stench. Two nearby buildings toppled on the stall, leaving a gigantic mess of bricks, shattered glass and metal. The stallholders of Medina say there are many bodies still buried there. “I still haven’t got a tent for my family and water and food is a problem, otherwise I would try to get help to get the bodies of my friends out of here,” said Alishah. Alishah has been sleeping near the ruins of his house with his family. “Out in the open under the stars is where we’ve been sleeping,” he says. “It’s cold, but we’re getting used to it now, although we’re scared about winter coming. We need to get a tent before then otherwise we won’t survive.” In Jalalabad Park a camp has sprung up with rudimentary toilet facilities – plastic curtains hiding holes in the ground. Many survivors here have erected shelters out of pieces of wood, corrugated iron and detritus salvaged from the ruins of the city. Razian Bibi sleeps in one such hut measuring no more than 3 metres by 2 metres, sharing this tiny space with nine others. “I have four children and I have no blankets for them,” she said, stirring a pot of lentils on a stove made out of an upturned oil can with wood as fuel. “It’s cold and we need a tent.” Residents like Bibi are scared the government will make them leave the park as this camp is not officially recognised. “They said that we will have to move to another camp, but with my four little children, moving is hard, we want to stay here,” said Bibi. The number of camps in Muzaffarabad is not known, as most are ‘spontaneous’ areas where residents have gathered and put up tents and makeshift shelters. One aid worker said there were over 17, but as most of these camps are not official, residents face evacuation. British charity Oxfam warned this week of a looming health crisis in the tented camps. “Unless conditions are improved in these camps, diseases like cholera could spread like wildfire,” Oxfam’s earthquake relief head, Jane Cockin, said. “If disease does break out in the camps, the number of deaths could far exceed those in danger in their villages.” The cold has resulted in a surge in acute respiratory infections, with much worse to come in the next few weeks if the shelter situation is not resolved, said Dr Khalid Shibib, head of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Muzaffarabad. The priority for the WHO, as with many aid agencies, is reaching survivors in isolated valleys and highlands before they become inaccessible due to winter snow. “Respiratory infections are from the cold, from a lack of shelter, and you can die from it,” Shibib said. The earthquake destroyed 41 percent of all hospitals, as well as most rural health centres. More than 75,000 people were injured and are in need of urgent medical or surgical care. Now Shibib warns that poor sanitation, lack of safe drinking water and inadequate shelter could pose a threat of disease. There have so far been cases of diarrhoea and the health ministry says there have been some 1,130 cases of dysentery, 139 cases of tetanus, of whom 41 have died, and several deaths from measles. “The health picture now is less and less injuries from the earthquake and more and more communicable diseases,” Shibib said. Some 790,000 children aged between five and 18 years are estimated to have been affected by the earthquake and 10,000 schools damaged or destroyed. Assessments by the education ministry have highlighted the need for tents to serve as temporary schools as well as training 25,000 new teachers. But with worsening conditions, the threat of disease outbreaks and the desperate need for basic provisions, such as tents, a severe lack of funds is impeding the aid effort. Some say the poor donor response is a result of ‘donor fatigue’ due to a recent glut of natural catastrophes, such as Hurricane Katrina and the Asian tsunami, leaving donor countries feeling financially drained. The Pakistani government announced it will start compensation payments of about $416 per family for the loss of their homes, but survivors say they just want shelter. “All I need is a tent,” said Alishah. “I just want to appeal to the international community to help us. We know that they have given a lot of money to the tsunami, but all we ask is that they don’t forget about us,” he pleaded. “Otherwise we’ll die in the cold.”"
West African leaders call for review of Taylor's asylum deal,"The leaders of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone have publicly asked Nigeria to review the asylum deal which stands between former Liberian president Charles Taylor and a trial to face charges of crimes against humanity. Accusations have been mounting that onetime warlord Taylor, currently holed up in a luxury compound in the remote town of Calabar in the Niger Delta, has been violating the terms of his exile agreement that was drawn up in August 2003 and helped end Liberia's 14-year civil war. ""(We) agreed to suggest to the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that there may now be need for a review of the terms of the temporary stay granted to Charles Taylor,"" Liberian interim leader Gyude Bryant, Guinean Prime Minister Cellou Diallo and Sierra Leone's President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah said in a joint statement, a copy of which was obtained by IRIN. The three leaders met in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, last week. A UN-backed court in the same city wants to try Taylor on 17 counts of crimes against humanity perpetrated in Sierra Leone's civil war, which officially ended early in 2002. The former Liberian leader is accused of funding the Revolutionary United Front campaign, keeping the rebels stocked with guns and ammunition in exchange for smuggled diamonds. The joint statement from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, which came to light over the weekend, made reference to a number of recent allegations that, if true, would violate Taylor's exile agreement. It noted accusations that Taylor had been involved in an assassination attempt on Guinea President Lansana Conte in January 2005, that he had been backing armed groups in Liberia and making telephone calls to senior government officials there as the country prepares for crunch October elections designed to return it to democracy. The three leaders raised the possibility of Nigeria referring the matter to the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) if needed. The question of Taylor's asylum has cropped up with increasing frequency for Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. US President George W. Bush referred to it at the White House earlier this year, international rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have launched campaigns to bring Taylor to justice, and UN human rights chief Louise Arbour last month called for him to stand trial. Obasanjo has always said he would hand Taylor over, should a future elected government in Liberia ever decide to press charges and demand his extradition. Liberians go to the polls on 11 October to vote in new leaders, but whoever wins will not take power until January. Nigerian officials were not immediately available for comment on Monday on the joint statement. Taylor, after training as a guerrilla fighter in Libya, launched a bush war in Liberia on Christmas Day 1989. His faction gained the upper hand and he was finally elected president in 1997 but it was to be another six years before the war finally ended."
British funding for AU mission in Darfur increased,"Britain has raised its contribution to the African Union's (AU) peacekeeping force in the strife-torn region of Darfur in western Sudan to £19 million (US $34.65 million), up from £6.6 million ($12 million), to enable the pan-African body to expand its mission. The British secretary of state for international development, Hilary Benn, said on Monday the money would be used to buy up to 500 additional vehicles and to purchase more rapid-deployment equipment. He said Britain had played a leading role in helping the AU mission. The initial contribution of £6.6 million was announced at the AU Donors' Conference in Addis Ababa on 26 May. ""As part of NATO's efforts to assist AMIS [African Union Mission in Sudan] expansion, the UK [United Kingdom] is also ready - subject to AU requirements and other donors' contributions - to support the airlift, co-ordinated by NATO, of up to three battalions into Darfur,"" Benn said. The AU troops are helping to maintain a shaky ceasefire in Darfur where violence erupted in February 2003 when rebels took up arms in a bid to end what they said was state discrimination and marginalisation of the region's ethnic African inhabitants. Although the AU troops have a limited capacity trying to secure a region the size of France, violence has subsided in the areas where they are deployed. The AU has announced plans to increase its strength to 7,700 troops and civilian police, at a cost of $466 million. Britain had also agreed to provide a Mobile Air Movements team of up to 15 people if required, Benn said. Benn said Britain was also eager to support the civilian police contingent of the AU mission. ""We will support the EU's efforts to offer the AU a package of support, including training for the AU police and technical experts and advisers,"" he said. He added, ""We will also build accommodation for AU civilian police in camps for internally displaced people and villages, so that they can be deployed where they are needed most."" Benn also announced the appointment of Alan Goulty as Britain's special representative for Darfur."
"France ready to cooperate in genocide probe, envoy says","France is ready to cooperate with the government of Rwanda when it begins its investigation of the role of the French in the 1994 genocide, an official said on Thursday. ""I have stated it clearly in different meetings with government officials that France is ready to cooperate in good spirit and goodwill with the [Rwandan] commission,"" Dominique Decherf, the French ambassador, told IRIN in the capital, Kigali. Rwanda's cabinet adopted a decision to set up an independent commission to gather the evidence of France’s involvement in the genocide where 937,000 people died, according to the Rwandan government. In April, when Rwanda commemorated the 10th anniversary of the genocide, President Paul Kagame accused France of having knowingly trained and armed the government troops and Hutu militia, who have largely been blamed for the genocide. However, France has always denied involvement in the killings and a French parliamentary commission in 1998 cleared France of responsibility for the genocide while also admitting that ""strategic errors"" had been made. The Rwandan National Assembly recently appointed a select committee to draft the mandate of the commission of inquiry, which would be debated during a plenary session before the end of this year. Rwandan Foreign Minister Charles Murigande welcomed Decherf's remarks saying he hoped the move would be in the spirit of improving the strained relationship between Rwanda and France. Bilateral relations between the two countries have remained shaky, characterised by accusations and counter accusations, with the post-genocide Rwandan government accusing France of having played a patronage role in the genocide. Kagame accused France of taking part in the genocide after a French newspaper, Le Monde, published articles blaming him for ordering the shooting down of the plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana. Habyarimana's death sparked a wave of mass killings and plunged the country into a decade of war that is only now slowly abating. The newspaper reports were based on a six-year inquiry by French Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, who was asked to investigate the crash by relatives of the French flight crew."
Kagame says no to negotiations with Congo-based rebels,"Rwandan President Paul Kagame said on Friday that his government welcomes a recent conciliatory declaration by a Rwandan Hutu rebel group based in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, he said his government would not hold talks with the group as a precondition for its disarmament and repatriation of its members. ""All we will do is open the gates [border] for them,"" Kagame said. ""Those who wish to come are welcome. Those who wish to stay, it is their choice. And those who wish to continue fighting can do so."" According to various sources, about 10,000 combatants in the Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda (FDLR) are based in eastern DRC. Some of them are accused of taking part in the killing of an estimated 937,000 Rwandan Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Their presence in the DRC has fuelled instability in the region, and was used to justify Rwanda's invasions in 1996 and 1998. Kagame has continued to threaten to send Rwandan forces into the DRC if the rebels are not disarmed. In January, the African Union announced that it would help in efforts to disarm the Rwandan rebels. The announcement was ""politically and psychologically important,"" Jim Terrie, senior analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG), told IRIN earlier this month. He said it had helped the rebels ""recognize their isolation"". The leader of FDLR, Ignace Murwanashyaka, announced on 31 March that the group would end military operations against Rwanda and voluntarily return home. However, various analysts are concerned with the wording of Murwanashyaka's declaration, and worry he may try to set conditions for the return of his followers. One FDLR official is reported to have linked the return of the Hutu rebels to opening up the political process in Rwanda and to the government recognising that during the 1994 genocide Hutus also were killed on a massive scale. While acknowledging that the rebels do have some legitimate concerns about what will happen to them when they return to Rwanda, Terrie said that the process wool fail if the FDLR makes such political conditions. In an ICG policy report issued on 12 May, Terrie recommended that the Rwandan government hold ""non-political, technical discussions with FDLR leaders about return modalities,"" as well as provide ""monetary and other incentives for return, including an offer to integrate eligible commanders into its army"". The report also recommended that the government identify ""which commanders are, and which are not, sought by Rwandan courts for crimes of genocide and accept an option of third-country asylum for those not sought for serious crimes by its own courts or the [UN] International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda in Arusha"". Kagame's remarks on Friday suggest that the chances of his government offering such initiatives are slim. ""We appreciate the [FDLR] statement to disarm and come back home,"" Kagame said, but ""we will not have any discussions on modalities of repatriation."""
France donates military equipment worth US $3.2 million,"France donated on Thursday 46 military vehicles and equipment, worth US $3.2 million, for use by the army and the gendarmerie in the Central African Republic (CAR). French Ambassador Jean Pierre Destouesse made the donation, on behalf of his government, to CAR leader Francois Bozize during a ceremony in the capital, Bangui. Bozize is also the defence minister. The donation, part of France's effort to improve security in its former colony, included communication equipment for the vehicles. The director of military cooperation in the French Foreign Ministry, Vice-Adml Herve Giraud, who was on a three-day visit to the country, also attended the ceremony. Giraud inspected military barracks in Bangui during his Tuesday-Thursday tour. ""I am here to assess your needs for them to be clearly identified so that we can bring the most efficient solutions,"" he told Bozize on Wednesday, in a speech broadcast by state-owned Television Centrafricaine. Giraud’s visit and the military donation coincided with the end of training of the first three CAR army battalions by France. The training of the Bataillon d’Intervention Mixte et d’Appui (BIMA) was officially closed on Thursday in Kassai Barracks in Bangui, in Giraud's presence. Also on Thursday, 160 gendarmes ended their training at the Kolongo Gendarmerie School in the city. French instructors and experts of the UN Peace-building Office in the CAR (BONUCA) instructed the new gendarmes from July to December 2003. The French donation also included military uniforms for the BIMA and for gendarmes. ""The implementation and the reinforcement of our ongoing military cooperation programmes will largely depend on the achievements of the first [trained] battalion and on the way its members maintain the equipment at their disposal,"" Destouesse said. He added that the newly trained soldiers would be judged on their ability to fight armed robbers and poachers, who continue to terrorise the public in parts of the country. Destouesse said that the new CAR army would now be able to prevent the entry of foreign troops ""who loot the country,"" or foreign rebels ""who transform your territory into a lawless space"". He was referring to former rebels from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who entered the CAR in 2001 and 2002 to help the then President Ange-Felix Patasse to fight rebels loyal to Bozize. Giraud said on Wednesday that apart from the ongoing training programmes, France would also give attention to the training of young army officers. Giraud’s visit was the fifth by a senior French official after the visits by Foreign Minister Dominique De Villepin in July 2003, Cooperation Minister Pierre Andre Wiltzer in November 2003, army Chief of Staff Henri Bentegeat and Defence Minister Michel Alliot Marie in December 2003. During her visit, Alliot Marie said France would support security efforts aimed at creating a peaceful atmosphere for the country's electoral process due to start in mid-2004 with a constitutional referendum. France has about 200 troops in the capital, Bangui."
Deforestation in south contributing to floods and landslides,"The depletion of fir tree forests in southern Kyrgyzstan is contributing to soil degradation, one of the major causes of subsequent floods and landslides, environmental scientists say. ""A lack of proper protection of forests, the growing human impact on nature and unlimited livestock grazing have sharply reduced areas covered by these trees and have also worsened their condition,"" Prof Biymyrza Toktoraliev, a prominent academic and ecologist, told IRIN in Osh, Kyrgyzstan's second largest city. No other trees are being cut down at the same rate as fir trees, Toktoraliev added. Moreover, harmful insects and pests are also said to be affecting the fir plantations. Professors at the technical university in Osh say there has been a sharp reduction in fir plantations in the south of the country. Fir trees covered over 230,000 hectares in the region half a century ago, while they shrunk by 68,000 hectares by the 1980s and halved by 2001, they say. According to the Osh Technical University, deforestation in these areas is creeping up annually by around 1 percent. Although this may not seem dramatic, experts note that the most worrying feature of the story is that fir trees grow extremely slowly - roughly 3 millimetres in height and 1.5 millimetres in width a year. It thus takes almost 1,000 years for a Turkestan fir (Juniperus turkestanica) tree to grow by 3 metres, while often Turkestan fir trees are 18-metres high. Turkestan fir forests cover parts of the Nookat district of Osh province, where the Kyrgyz-Ata National Park was set up, and the Sary-Chelek Biosphere Reserve in the southern Kyrgyz province of Jalal-Abad, as well as other mountainous areas of the region. Environmental specialists emphasise the role of fir trees in building habitat, protecting soil and regulating water. Growing on crevices, steep rocks and hills, evergreen trees enable normal snow melting and serve as a natural protection from avalanches and landslides. The roots of the fir trees are wide, spreading up to 150 metres, and strengthen the surface of the soil, which is vital for mountainous areas. Mountains cover more then 95 percent of Kyrgyzstan's territory. Moreover, these trees are a source of fresh air and their bactericidal effects are well known. Conifer trees of the juniper family growing in Alai, Turkestan and Chatkal mountain ranges can live for up to 5,000 years at altitudes of up to 3,500 metres above sea level. Local environmentalists say it is mainly local inhabitants that chop down fir trees for wood or sell them to vendors, an activity primarily caused by widespread poverty in the area. The average monthly salary in Kyrgyzstan is no more than US $35, while in rural areas that figure is even less."
"Army planes bomb north for second day, rebel leader says negotiations over","Rebel leader Guillaume Soro said on Friday he was no longer prepared to negotiate with the government after Ivorian army warplanes pounded towns across the rebel-held north for the second day running, killing at least 18 people. ""It is about assassinating us. The political option is not being put first,"" Soro told IRIN by telephone from the north of Cote d’Ivoire. ""I am no longer ready to negotiate."" The West African country has been split into a rebel-held north and a government-controlled south since September 2002, with around 10,000 peacekeepers from the UN and France standing guard in a buffer zone between the two sides. This week's attacks, which forced the UN to suspend its humanitarian operations, marked the first hostilities since a total ceasefire was signed in May last year. As fears rose that Cote d'Ivoire might tip back into full-scale civil war, regional leaders moved to find a way to contain the crisis. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is currently chairman of the African Union, will be holding a meeting on Saturday, his spokeswoman told reporters. ""There's going to be a high-level meeting at his farm tomorrow with representatives from West Africa and the African Union,"" spokeswoman Remi Oyo said. Provisional death toll stands at 18 Ivorian warplanes and helicopters on Friday dropped bombs on seven rebel-held towns including Baoulifla, Bonguera, Seguela and Vavoua, UN military officials said. French peacekeeping sources said bridges and rebel checkpoints had been among the hits. “We have a provisional death toll today of at least 18 people, of whom 16 were civilians,” said Philippe Moreux, a press officer for the UN Mission in Cote d’Ivoire (ONUCI). A rebel commander at Vavoua, a town just north of the buffer zone, put the death toll much higher, saying at least 54 people had been killed in attacks in his area. Friday’s assault followed a wave of bombings throughout Thursday on the central stronghold of Bouake - targeting a television station and the hotel where the rebel have their headquarters - and an attack around dusk on Korhogo, another rebel town further north. Medecins Sans Frontieres said its team in Bouake had been informed of many deaths, but had not been able to confirm the numbers themselves. However, they said 39 people had been sent for urgent treatment at the main hospital, including many civilians. An IRIN correspondent in Bouake, which lies 400 km north of Abidjan, said there had been no water or electricity in the town since Wednesday night and that residents were keeping off the streets and hiding, fearful of further raids. International community needs to do more UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has condemned the violation of the ceasefire, but the International Crisis Group (ICG), a leading political think tank, on Friday urged the international community to do more to protect civilians. ""The situation is extremely worrying. France and the United Nations have to live up to their mandates of protecting civilian lives,"" Mike McGovern, the ICG's West Africa project director, told IRIN by phone from New York. ""In Rwanda both the French and the UN were there and they allowed genocide to take place,” he said. “If the fighting is allowed to continue without strong intervention, we could not only see more civilian casualties as a consequence of fighting in the north, but ethnic cleansing.”

The government has bombed rebel towns to the east and west of Bouake
Ivorian army troops were massing men, vehicles and ammunition in the capital, Yamoussoukro, with some moving north into the buffer zone and converging on the town of Tiebissou, halfway to the rebel stronghold, Bouake. “A batallion of Moroccan peacekeepers have prevented two columns of Ivorian military vehicles getting through at Tiebissou,” French Defence Minister Michele Alliot-Marie told Radio France Internationale on Friday. “The UN forces will continue to intercept, with perhaps a more robust mandate tomorrow,” she added. ONUCI’s peacekeepers operate under a so-called Chapter 6 mandate, which means that they can only use force when UN staff or property is targeted. Should their mandate be made “more robust”, i.e. changed to Chapter 7, that would give them the possibility of using force to enforce peace. Attacks in Abidjan Meanwhile in Abidjan, the commercial capital of what used to be West Africa's economic success story, smoke streamed into the sky above the headquarters of the Rassemblement des Republicains (RDR) opposition party on Friday. Militants who support President Laurent Gbagbo had set fire to the building, gutting the inside. The RDR is led by former prime minister Alassane Ouattara, who was banned from standing against Gbagbo in the 2000 presidential election on the grounds that his father was not born in Cote d'Ivoire. The northern rebels want the constitution changed to allow Ouattara to participate in the next ballot, scheduled for October 2005. This is one of a series of reforms the government was supposed to push through in line with the French-brokered peace deal in 2003, and a West African summit in July this year. Its failure to do this was cited by the rebels as their reason for not sticking to an October disarmament deadline. The pro-Gbagbo militants also attacked the building of the main opposition party, the PDCI (Parti democratique de Cote d’Ivoire), on Thursday along with three newspapers they view as being hostile to the president. In another sign of a crackdown on the opposition, the head of the national television, who had been chosen by the rebels in the power-sharing government, was replaced. The militants, known as the Young Patriots, rallied outside army headquarters yesterday, demanding an all-out assault on the north, and some analysts see this week's bombings as an attempt by Gbagbo to appease his more radical supporters. ""I think he's trying to put pressure on the New Forces of course, but he may also being trying to satisfy the hard-line elements in his own ranks as well,"" said Stephen Ellis, an Africa specialist at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, who returned from Abidjan on Thursday. ""It's clear there's a serious risk of a coup."" Ellis said he doubted whether Gbagbo would go so far as to launch a full-scale attack on the north, given that French and UN peacekeepers were standing between the rebels and the Ivorian army. But he warned that if hardliner dreams of conquering the north were thwarted, then that might lead to reprisals on the ground in Abidjan. ""One of the big dangers now is that the southern opinion gets whipped up, as it has been, and they get frustrated at not being able to attack the north and then there's the big fear of ethnic massacres on a larger scale than we've seen before, especially in Abidjan where there's a big population of foreigners."""
Darfur peace talks back on track in Abuja,"Delegates representing Sudan's government and rebels fighting in the country's western Darfur region are set to resume talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, on Friday to seek an end to a conflict that has created Africa's worst humanitarian disaster. Previous talks collapsed six months ago after the government broke a ceasefire deal and mounted an offensive that seriously weakened rebel positions on the ground. With the government now withdrawn from the positions it acquired in December, African Union (AU) mediators are hopeful of a solution to the two-year conflict that has claimed more than 180,000 lives and forced two million people from their homes. ""We expect to continue the negotiations from where we left off by going straight into the negotiation of the key political issues, having reached a humanitarian agreement last year,"" said a senior AU official. In December, all parties agreed to open up access for humanitarian assistance to the millions in the region urgently in need of food aid. The AU will be mediating for a fourth time in Abuja between Khartoum and the two rebel groups: the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). Outstanding issues yet to be agreed by the Sudan government and the rebels - who took up arms in February 2003 alleging decades of neglect and oppression of Darfur's African tribes by Khartoum - hinge on recognition of ethnic, cultural and religious rights and equitable distribution of power and national wealth. Yet problems remain. In the run up to the talks there has been fighting between the two rebel movements. AU monitors on the ground in Darfur said at least 17 people were killed earlier this week when the larger rebel group, the SLA, launched attacks on positions held by the smaller JEM, an action likely to undermine the previous cohesion by the two groups noticed at earlier peace talks. And the United States and the European Union have squabbled over whether NATO should become involved in the airlift of AU peacekeeping troops to Darfur, and over the formal launch of a probe on alleged war crimes in Darfur by the International Criminal Court (ICC). To improve security in Darfur the AU plans to send in about 5,000 additional troops swelling the current force to over 7,000 troops. Both NATO and the EU have also been approached for logistical support. But while the US wants NATO to coordinate the airlift, France wants the assistance to be provided outside the framework of NATO. Despite opposition by Khartoum, the UN-backed ICC said on Monday it was beginning a formal investigation of allegations of atrocities against unarmed civilians in Darfur. The two rebel movements blame the Sudan government and its reportedly close ally, the Janjawid Arab militia, of scorched earth attacks on unarmed Darfur villagers, slaughtering tens of thousands in the past two years. To help those in dire need in Darfur, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it began airlift of food aid to the region on 4 June and expects the operation to last for two months, delivering some 4,000 tonnes of food to more than 220,000 people."
Relatives of air crash victims give France payment deadline,"Relatives of the 49 Congolese victims of a French jetliner crash in Niger on 19 September 1989 demanded on Friday that the French government pay them compensation in full by 31 March. In a declaration issued on Friday in Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo (ROC), the association said: ""The association of the victims' families in Brazzaville disapprove of a partial compensation, as was suggested under the pretext of an urgent compensation, and demands that all families will be fully compensated before 31 March 2005."" The UTA DC-10 jetliner crashed in Niger's Tenere Desert en route from Brazzaville to Paris, killing 170 passengers, 49 of them nationals of the ROC. The cause of the accident was suspected to be a bomb. Years later, the Libyan government accepted involvement in the disaster and promised to compensate each family of the victims US $1 million. By July 2004, the Libyan government had remitted the full amount of $170 million to the French government. The families now demand the immediate release of these funds no later than end of March. ""If nothing is done until then, we will call on the French government, and in particular, on President [Jacques] Chirac and the ministers of foreign affairs and human rights for their solidarity in our cause,"" Norbert Dabira, representing the Brazzaville association, said in Friday's declaration. The French and Congolese families of people who died in the crash formed a joint foundation two months ago, based in France, to administer the Libyan compensation. However, in its declaration on Friday, the Congolese association said it had never been consulted in any decisions over compensation. ""The foundation has never made official contact, since it was inaugurated, with the Association of the Relatives of Victims of Brazzaville,"" it said. ""The Association of the Relatives of the Victims of Brazzaville has the impression that it has been brushed aside,"" the association added. Regardless of nationality, none of the victims' families have received any compensation as of yet."
Peace talks for Darfur on the horizon,"Peace negotiations for Sudan's war-torn Darfur region are on the horizon, with the government reportedly agreeing for the first time to attend talks that are internationally monitored. An EU official told IRIN on Thursday that the government had agreed to meet the Darfur rebel leaders in Chad with representatives from the EU and others present as observers. He said the details surrounding the talks were ""still under discussion"". An official at the US embassy in Khartoum told IRIN the matter was still being discussed, but that the ""US will be present if talks take place"". There was no comment available from the Sudanese government on Thursday. The presence of international monitors is a basic precondition to talks for both Darfur's rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM). Chad, which mediated talks with the SLA until they broke down in mid-December, is deemed by both groups to be too friendly with Khartoum to be a neutral mediator. Dr Khalil Ibrahim, the exiled chairman of the JEM, confirmed to IRIN from France that he would be prepared to attend talks if they were monitored by ""neutral supervisors"" in a suitable country, which could include Chad. ""Under no circumstances"" would he attend talks in Sudan, he said, adding that he was waiting to hear about concrete plans and was ""ready at any time"". Abd al-Wahid Muhammad Ahmad al-Nur, the SLA chairman, told IRIN he would also send a delegation to internationally monitored talks in Chad. Meanwhile, government-backed Arab militias in Darfur continue to kill, rape and displace non-Arab civilians in increasingly frequent and vicious attacks. Over 700,000 people have been displaced, while 110,000 have fled across the border to neighbouring Chad. In a separate development, the UN said on Thursday it was ""deeply concerned"" at the recent detention by the SLA of two Chinese water engineers working in Southern Darfur. Abd al-Wahid denied the charge, accusing the Sudanese-backed Janjawid militias of having kidnapped the two men."
Darfur peace talks resume in Abuja after delays,"Peace talks between the Sudanese government and rebels in the country’s Darfur region resumed in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Monday, four days behind schedule, with neither side appearing to budge from their already stated positions. Rebels of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA) and its ally, the Justice and Equity Movement (JEM), continue to insist on resolving what they call “security issues” before signing a protocol on humanitarian assistance. The humanitarian protocol was agreed in principle by both sides during the previous round of peace talks in Abuja in late August and early September, but the rebels refused to sign it. They are demanding the immediate disarming of the pro-government Janjawid militia movement, which draws its members from tribes of Arab nomads. The Janjawid have been blamed for repeated attacks on black African civilians in Darfur which the United States has condemned as genocide. However, Khartoum is insisting that the rebels disarm first. African Union (AU) mediators believe the signing of the humanitarian agreement would open the way for a massive international relief effort in Darfur, a semi-arid region the size of France, to deal with what the United Nations has described as the world’s worst humanitarian disaster. The United Nations said last week that a third of Darfur's six million population now required relief assistance following a 10 percent increase in the number of needy people during September. It estimated that 1.6 million people had been internally displaced within Darfur and that a further 400,000 victims of the conflict required aid to be brought to them in their homes. The UN refugee agency UNHCR warned that unless the situation in Darfur were stabilised soon, tens of thousands more refugees could cross into the semi-desert of eastern Chad, where 200,000 have already sought shelter in refugee camps. An estimated 70,000 people have died from hunger and disease as a result of the two-year-old conflict, apart from those who have been killed in fighting. The peace talks in Abuja were originally due to resume last Thursday, but their start was delayed until Monday because of the late arrival of many rebel delegates. “For now we’re just holding preliminary talks with both sides to work out an agenda for the talks,” an AU official told IRIN. “How well we do it might indicate how well the talks will go,” he added. Diplomats are worried that the onset of the dry season will see an upsurge in fighting in Darfur, in defiance of a widely disregarded truce that was agreed in April. The recent emergence of two new rebel groups in Darfur who are not represented at the Abuja talks has meanwhile cast doubt on the ability of the delegates attending the peace conference to negotiate an agreement that will really stick. The United Nations has demanded that the Sudanese government rein in the Janjawid, accusing the Arab militia force mounted on horses and camels, of committing atrocities against unarmed civilians. But it has stopped short of accusing the Janjawid and the authorities in Khartoum of genocide. Last week, the AU agreed to upgrade its team of 150 ceasefire monitors in Darfur backed by a 300-strong protection force into a military force of more than 3,000 men with an extended mandate to protect humanitarian operations and deter armed groups from attacking civilians. Javier Solana, the external relations commissioner of the European Union, said during a visit to the AU headquarters in Addis Ababa on Saturday that the EU and its member states would contribute more than US$100 million towards the $221 million estimated cost of fielding this enlarged force. Said Djinnit, the AU Commissioner for Peace and Security, told Reuters on Monday that the first reinforcements of Nigerian and Rwandan troops would be flown into Darfur later this week."
Background to the peace process,"As the Sudanese government and the main rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) prepare to resume their meetings on 17 February for what many hope will mark the final stage of their 18-month peace process, rumblings of discontent in some parts of the country could have far-reaching repercussions on the gains already made during their talks in Kenya. Bitter foes, the government and the SPLM/A are tentatively reaching agreement on hitherto inadmissible topics, and hopes are high that a comprehensive peace deal will finally put an end to a continuous and devastating 20-year civil war, during which about 2 million people have lost their lives, and millions more their homes, livelihoods and even their country. AT WAR SINCE 1956 As the Horn of Africa analyst, Dan Connell, notes, Sudan has been at war with itself since the day it emerged from colonial rule in 1956. By then, the stage for conflict had already been set by the British and the Egyptians by way of a scenario of glaring inequalities between the north and the south, with much of the country's resources and the instruments of policy-making concentrated in the Arab north. In such a context, the mostly Christian and animist southerners took up arms to fight against the imbalance. There has been almost constant conflict, alleviated only by an 11-year hiatus from 1972 when a peace deal gave southerners limited regional autonomy. But fighting, led by the SPLM/A, resumed in 1983 after the then president, Ja'far Numayri, dissolved the regional government and imposed Islamic shari’ah law nationwide. He was overthrown in 1985 in a military coup led by Lt-Gen Siwar al-Dhahab, who dissolved Numayri's ruling Sudanese Socialist Union, then paved the way for a return to civilian rule by way of elections in 1986, which brought to power Sadiq al-Mahdi, leader of the Ummah Party, as prime minister. Al-Mahdi was in turn deposed in 1989 in another military coup, this time led by the current president, Lt-Gen Umar Hasan al-Bashir. THE PEACE DEAL IN A NUTSHELL Since 1994, the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) had been attempting to broker peace between the SPLM/A and the government, but its efforts failed until a breakthrough was made in 2002, leading to the landmark Machakos Protocol signed in Kenya on 20 July. This success is partly due to the stewardship of the process by the chief mediator, Kenya’s Gen Lazarus Sumbeiywo, but also because each side acknowledged the other’s chief concern - the SPLM/A’s demand for a referendum on self-determination after a six-and-a-half-year interim period, and Khartoum's insistence on retaining shari’ah law in areas under its control. The result was a momentum to move forward. In October 2002, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed on a cessation of hostilities for the duration of the talks and, in the course of the negotiations, momentous accords were reached on key issues. These included security arrangements for the interim period (which provide for the deployment of joint units in some areas) and agreement on wealth-sharing (under which oil revenue will be equally split between the south and the north, and a dual banking system will be in operation). The talks have been given added weight by face-to-face meetings in the Kenyan Rift Valley town of Naivasha between the SPLM/A leader, John Garang, and Sudanese First Vice-President Ali Uthman Muhammad Taha. Both sides have made references to the irreversibility of the process. Remaining sticking points include the status of three disputed regions: southern Blue Nile, the Nuba mountains and Abyei, which are technically in the north, but whose inhabitants, according to the SPLM/A, identify with the south. Progress has been made on southern Blue Nile and the Nuba mountains, but observers say Abyei is particularly problematic because of its large oil reserves and rich pasture lands. The issue of power-sharing during the interim period also remains unresolved. HUMANITARIAN DEVASTATION A probable peace deal between the government and the SPLM/A does not mean that Sudan’s overwhelming humanitarian problems will be at an end. Instead, many of the burdens will be concentrated within the country as millions of displaced people try to regain their homes, and hundreds of thousands of refugees start streaming back. They will be returning to a country ripped apart by years of war and neglect. A massive rehabilitation programme will be needed for the south - an infrastructure will have to be built, services extended to the area, and people will have to learn how to live in peacetime rather than wartime. "
Peace talks resume in Kenya,"A possible final round of Sudanese talks resumed in Kenya on Tuesday, with both warring parties reaffirming their commitment to signing a peace peace deal to end the country's 20-year civil war. The talks, facilitated by the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), are widely expected to lead to the signing of the final peace agreement between the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). On Wednesday, IGAD facilitators were still carrying out consultative meetings with the parties in order to draw up the agenda for the negotiations, Samson Kwaje, the SPLM/A spokesman, told IRIN. The talks, which had made substantial progress in the areas of wealth-sharing and security arrangements during a six-year transitional period to follow the signing of a final accord, were adjourned in early February at the request of the government delegation to enable its members to travel to Mecca to perform the Islamic pilgrimage of Hajj. The two pending issues are of power-sharing and the status of three disputed regions, namely Abyei, Nuba Mountains and southern Blue Nile during the transition. Sa'id Khatib, the official government spokesman, said this round of talks was ""of great importance"", because it would iron out the remaining issues before the final agreement. He said the current round would last until 16 March, by which time, it was hoped, a final agreement would have been reached, he was quoted as saying by the Sudan News Agency, Suna. The outstanding issues are expected to be resolved during direct negotiations between First Vice-President Ali Uthman Muhammad Taha and SPLM/A Chairman John Garang, both of whom arrived for the talks in Naivasha on Tuesday."
"Peace stalemate could rumble on, and on - analysts","Six weeks after a lapsed UN deadline, two African heavyweight leaders fly in to divided Cote d’Ivoire at the weekend to make a fresh try at finding a prime minister acceptable to all sides in the conflict. But analysts are increasingly pessimistic of a quick fix. After a failed mediation attempt just 10 days ago, South African President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian President and African Union Chairman Olusegun Obasanjo are due back on Sunday to attempt to wrest an agreement on a new prime minister to shepherd the war-torn nation to disarmament and elections before a UN deadline of October 2006. “I am pessimistic about a resolution in Cote d’Ivoire within the next 12 months unless something cataclysmic happens outside the country that changes the balance,” said Richard Reeves, Associate Fellow of the Africa Programme, Chatham House. “Even then, the situation would be likely to get worse before getting better.” The appointment of the new head of government is the latest bone of contention between rebels holding the north of the country and President Laurent Gbagbo, who controls the fertile cocoa-growing south. Under a UN Security Council plan hatched some weeks ago, Gbagbo, whose mandate ended 31 October, is supposed to hand over much of his powers to a new prime minister. But the world’s top cocoa producer has been the scene of a series of botched peace deals over the past three years. Since a September 2002 rebellion left the country sliced in two, mediators have come and gone incessantly, including Senegal, Togo under late president Gnassingbe Eyadema, former colonial power France, Ghana, Gabon and lately South Africa, the AU and Nigeria. Though peace efforts first got off to a swift start with Senegal, then chair of the regional economic body ECOWAS, momentum was soon lost with diplomats blaming the intransigence of the Ivorians and clashing egos within the Economic Community of West African States. “I am not proud of spending four months of my time, almost 24 hours per day, trying to help the Cote d’Ivoire crisis,” Cheikh Tidiane Gadio, Foreign Minister of Senegal, said after the event. “Dealing with conflicts, managing conflicts - that should not be a way of life. We have something else to do: health, agriculture, education, infrastructure…we have so much on our plate.” Though the former colonial power France managed to thrash out the January 2003 Marcoussis peace deal - which has served as the blueprint for all subsequent accords in Ghana and South Africa - France has since withdrawn, at least visibly, from negotiations. Violent anti-French riots swept through the government-run south in November 2004 and early this year, when packing his bags, Gildas le Lidec told IRIN he was leaving Cote d’Ivoire with a “profound sense of failure”. Mbeki was called in to help in November 2004. But despite intensive mediation and some success in amending controversial legislation, the South Africa bid stopped short of resolving two major issues - disarmament and the question of nationality. That failure caused the collapse of a plan to hold elections last October, which was when the UN stepped in to call for a new prime minister. But the New Forces rebels have turned their backs on Mbeki and his team, accusing them of bias in Gbagbo’s favour, and Obasanjo has had to be called in. “Obviously Mbeki is regretting getting involved,” said Reeves. “It’s interesting to see how things have changed: three years ago everyone wanted a piece of the negotiations.” Meanwhile, diplomats agree that mutual mistrust, inflexibility and lack of goodwill between Gbagbo’s government, the various political opposition parties and the rebels are so deep-rooted that peace could be a long way away. “It will take years to get the country back on track,” said one Western diplomat. “The Ivorian leaders have absolutely no vision of where their country should be in say, twenty years from now. They talk to each other all the time, but there is no real political dialogue.” The latest row is over the composition of the National Electoral Commission that will organise the polls. Last week, the Supreme Court declared null and void the election of its chairman on the grounds that several members were unfairly excluded from the vote. Preparations for the elections remain on hold until the electoral commission can agree on a new chairman or until the new prime minister outlines how the commission should be set up and what its responsibilities will be. “They need to develop some habits like discussing and not just reflecting a political standpoint,” UN special envoy for the elections, Antonio Monteiro, told IRIN. “Individually they want elections, they want to collaborate, but when we get to the real issues it all falls apart…it’s totally divided.” Sanctions remain a threat and on Wednesday, the UN Security Council reminded the factions that it could impose travel bans or asset freezes on anyone seen as obstructing the peace process. ""Travel and asset freezes are likely to have more impact than an arms embargo as neither side has need for arms procurement currently. But if people's personal and financial status are affected - that's a different matter,"" said Alex Vines, member of a UN panel of experts that earlier this month submitted a report investigating compliance with a 2004 arms embargo. ""In the short term it's the individual sanctions - the travel bans and assets freezes - that could have some impact, but as with all sanctions they will become less effective with time, as loopholes and ways around the sanctions are found,"" Vines told IRIN. Be it new sanctions or settling on a name for the post of prime minister, many diplomats think it is time for the international community to toughen up. “Those involved in the crisis don’t want to sacrifice for the good of the country. It’s getting to a stage where outside pressure has to be applied,” an African diplomat told IRIN. “Ultimately, a bit of force may have a positive effect.”"
Prospects for peace in the north,"Uganda's northern region, the scene of a bitter 18-year old civil war between government forces and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels is experiencing a flicker of hope. Dozens of rebels have recently surrendered to government forces, with an attendant decline in violence in the north over the past few weeks, according to relief agencies operating in the region. Many of the LRA officers who have surrendered are being taken by the military to different places in the region to encourage reconciliation and peace. During these ""tours"", they are using every opportunity to appeal to colleagues still in the bush to abandon the fight and come home. According to military statistics 519 former rebels, including 22 senior commanders, have surrendered since January, most of them over the past few weeks. The army says it has captured another 215 and killed some 800 others over the same period, while 1,768 former abductees, mainly children, have been rescued. REBELLION FIZZLING OUT The Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) believe that the rebellion is fizzling out, mainly because the LRA has been ""denied the opportunity to replenish its ranks through abductions"", according to Maj Shaban Bantariza, the army spokesman. He concedes, however, that even if this trend continues, it will take time before peace is realised in the region and the internally displaced persons (IDPs), estimated at over 1.6 million, can go home and resume their normal lives. ""We have denied [LRA leader] Joseph Kony the opportunity to replenish his ranks through abduction. We have killed many of his commanders and fighters, and for sure he is existing on borrowed time,"" Bantariza said, stressing that this was the result of the UPDF's operations. ""The military option is succeeding. It has become a predominant actor in the peace process and the pacification of northern Uganda, because in the past two to three months there has been hardly a major act by the LRA and there has been relative peace in the region,"" he added. UN MONITORING EVENTS The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Activities (OCHA) in Gulu said it had taken note of the impact of the surrenders, but warned against complacency. ""This calmness has not yet trickled down to change people's perceptions. We have witnessed an increase in the number of night commuters in Gulu for example,"" the head of the OCHA office in Gulu, Andrew Timpson, told IRIN. Many relief and church workers in the region concede that the recent surrenders are a step in the right direction and hope that more LRA fighters will eventually come out of the bush. But the humanitarian situation in the area is worse than ever, according to Pietro Galli, the emergency coordinator of the Italian relief agency, AVSI, in northern Uganda. The conflict in northern Uganda has been characterised by inexplicable cruelty. Its main victims have been child abductees subsequently forced to fight or abused sexually, while a whole generation of other children has been forced to grow up in squalid IDP camps. ""The traumatic nightmare and tension of the people remain. We still deliver relief, using escorts, but the surrenders are a good sign and we hope more will come out,"" said Galli. ""The humanitarian situation, however, has become more critical,"" he added. CHURCH LEADERS OPTIMISTIC The head of the Roman Catholic Church in northern Uganda, Archbishop John Baptist Odama, referred to the new trend as ""a great thing"" and expressed support for the move to have former LRA officers campaign to persuade others to follow their example. ""Since the number of those surrendering increased, there has been general calm. It seems that there is a new sense suggesting that benefiting from the amnesty is the way to go. And we all need to praise the UPDF for treating those surrendering very well, including sparing the life of Kenneth Banya [a senior LRA commander captured recently], and this has helped in confidence building,"" he said in Gulu. Referring to a radio programme featuring rebel commanders who had surrendered two days earlier, he said: ""This is a great achievement. It is a big breakthrough. Everybody should forgive, because this is an opportunity of mercy, and let mercy triumph."" Church leaders still maintain, however, that the continuing application of force of arms cannot deliver the much-needed peace and solve the region's problems. They complain that the government has paid insufficient attention to dialogue, as many within its ranks regard talking peace with the rebels as conceding defeat. The Acholi Religious Leaders' Peace Initiative (ARLPI) insists that dialogue constitutes the most realistic and surest way towards achieving a lasting peace. This is not the first time that peace seems to have crept over the horizon in northern Uganda. In 1994, a government minister, Betty Bigombe, almost convinced the LRA to come to the negotiating table, and was about to clinch a deal with them. But this move collapsed when President Yoweri Museveni issued an ultimatum to the rebels to surrender, or face the might of his army. The LRA reacted by digging in, and 10 years later peace remains in abeyance. Another church leader and a member of ARLPI, Monsignor Matthew Odong, criticised the government for what he called indecisiveness. ""The government seems indecisive on what to do about the crisis. One moment it's ready to talk peace and the next it's ready to wage war. War has not worked in 18 years; now peace must be given a chance,"" he said in a recently published interview. Commenting on the 1994 botched attempt on peace talks, Odongo said, ""Now if President Museveni can recreate that original effort, we will achieve peace before the end of this year. It's a win-win situation for everyone: the government, the citizens and the LRA."""
Opposition and Gbagbo to talk peace,"Opposition parties say they will hold talks with President Laurent Gbabgo on Tuesday, in what will be their first face to face meeting since the government of reconciliation fell apart in March. However, rebel leaders have refused to attend. Leaders of the New Forces rebel group, still reeling from an assassination attempt last week on their leader, Guillaume Soro, on Sunday accused Gbabgo of stalling for time while he laid plans to launch a full-fledged war on them. “We will not go to the meeting because we are not ready to negotiate with Gbagbo,” Amadou Kone, director of the cabinet for Soro, told IRIN from the rebel headquarters of Bouake. The official spokesman for the New Forces, Sidiki Konate, was doubtful of any breakthrough. However, he told IRIN that although the New Forces would not attend the talks “physically”, they would stand by any agreements made by other G7 leaders in their absence. “We don’t believe anything will come of this meeting because Gbagbo himself is the main obstacle to peace in Cote d’Ivoire,” Konate said. The G7 is made up of the three rebel groups, now known as the New Forces, and the four opposition parties that signed the Marcoussis peace deal with the government in January 2003. G7 ministers, who have repeatedly accused Gbagbo of blocking the implementation of Marcoussis, have boycotted that power-sharing government since March after more than 100 of their supporters were killed by security forces and pro-Gbagbo militia while trying to stage a demonstration for peace. Alphonse Djedje-Mady, the secretary general of the main opposition party, the Democratic party of Cote d’Ivoire (PDCI), and spokesman for the G7 will be attending the meeting. “One can not implement Marcoussis and refuse to negotiate with the president,” he told IRIN. The agenda for the meeting includes a list of most pressing concerns submitted to the president by the coalition of opposition and rebel groups last March. The French-brokered peace plan ended a civil war that erupted with a September 2002 rebellion and left Cote d’Ivoire split between a rebel-held north and a government loyalist south. The announcement of the Tuesday meeting came hours after a 14-member United Nations Security Council delegation visit to Cote d’Ivoire, which warned political leaders and rebels to stop obstructing the stalled peace process. The head of the Security Council mission, British Ambassador Emyr Jones Parry, said if Marcoussis continued to be blocked, those responsible would be called to account. Last weekend, Gbagbo met with the Ghanaian, Togolese and Nigerian heads of state to begin preparations for a regional summit to resolve the Ivorian stand-off. An official at the presidential office told IRIN that that meeting could take place in the Ivorian capital, Yamoussoukro “in the coming days”."
Darfur rebel groups threaten not to resume peace talks,"The two main rebel groups in the conflict-affected western Sudanese region of Darfur have said they will not resume talks with the Khartoum government unless ""war criminals"" in the region are prosecuted. In a statement issued from the Eritrean capital, Asmara, on Thursday, the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) said that justice was a precondition for peace in Darfur. They also demanded the removal of African Union (AU) peace monitors from Darfur, saying they were no longer ""impartial"". According to the rebels, the UN, the European Union and Eritrea should conduct monitoring activities. ""The two movements view the issue of trial of the perpetrators as the foremost priority in resolving the conflict in Darfur, especially after they have been named,"" the rebels said. ""The two [have] resolved to resume the negotiations only after the apprehension and trial of the criminals in an international court or tribunal."" However, the Sudanese state minister for foreign affairs, Najib Al-Khair Abdul-Wahab, described the demand by the JEM as ""a maneuver and attempt to weaken the African role"". The minister, in a statement issued through the official Sudanese News Agency, said, ""the responsibility for the solution of Darfur problems will be the task of Africa, adding that any attempt to weaken that role is regarded as a violation of the African consensus"". Talks between the two groups and the government have taken place intermittently in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, since August. President Olusegun Obasanjo, as chairman of the AU, has personally played a leading role as a mediator. However, the talks have made little progress and the latest round ended in stalemate in December. Diplomats said the SLM/A had appeared willing to resume talks with Khartoum, but the JEM had questioned the AU's continued role as a mediator, accusing its officials of a pro-Khartoum bias. Recently, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sudan, Jan Pronk, visited Asmara for talks with government and Darfur rebel representatives in yet another bid to kick-start the Abuja negotiations. The UN has described the Darfur situation as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. It estimates that 2.4 million people in the region are dependant on aid for survival. A recent UN report on atrocities in Darfur concluded that while horrific war crimes had taken place, which merited referral to the International Court of Justice, they did not amount to genocide. In their statement, the two rebel groups appealed to ""outside mediators"" to take over from the AU, saying the pan-African body had lost all credibility in the region and was no longer seen as impartial. ""This is a human right,"" Khalil Ibrahim, JEM president, told reporters in Asmara after issuing the statement. ""Is it wrong that we say this mediator [the AU] is not going to bring peace in Sudan - please find us another mediator?"" Obasanjo, in a statement issued by his spokesman in Abuja on 8 March, said the AU was still seeking an acceptable means of bringing Darfur violators to justice and had not taken a final decision on the issue. ""President Obasanjo wishes to state that no consensus has been reached in the AU with the government of Sudan on the matter and there has been no agreement with the United Nations Security Council on it,"" the statement said. ""Although President Obasanjo had consultations on the issue of Darfur with President Mohammed El-Bashir and First Vice President el-Hajj Uthman Mohammed Taha [of Sudan] in Abuja recently, nothing has so far been agreed and the AU's search for an acceptable arrangement to bring the culprits to justice goes on,"" it added. ""When a position is adopted, it would be harmonised with the views of the UN Security Council."" The AU currently has a monitoring force numbering about 1,942 troops out of an original target of 4,000. The UN, in a report released on Friday, hailed the success of the AU contingent in the area around Labado in South Darfur. Prior to the AU deployment, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in the report, the area had suffered some of the worst fighting in recent months. However, the AU troops' presence had had a calming effect, which led to the return of some internally displaced persons. ""A fully staffed and effective AMIS [African Union Mission in the Sudan] will increase the chances that serious clashes can be prevented or minimised,"" Annan said, calling on the international community to strengthen the AU force in Darfur."
Forgiveness as an instrument of peace,"Peter Otim was forced to join the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 1995. Rising to the rank of Lt, he fought against the Ugandan government, killing and maiming several civilians along the way. ""In January, I gave myself up to the UPDF [Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces], but rather than being arrested or tried for being a rebel, I was given amnesty,"" said Otim, proudly displaying his certificate of amnesty. In 2000, the Uganda government passed a blanket amnesty law, designed to provide total immunity from prosecution to any rebel who voluntarily surrendered to the government. ""The act was passed in a deliberate effort to try and find a peaceful way of ending the conflicts and rebellions the country has had,"" Justice Peter Onega, chairman of the Amnesty Commission, said in his paper, ""The Amnesty Process: Opportunities and Challenges"". ""Battered into a position of submission, aggravated by the fact that many of the rebels inflicting atrocities on them were their own children forced into rebellion, elders and religious leaders from the [worst affected] Acholi region began to advocate for amnesty,"" Onega explained. Since the Amnesty Act was passed, more than 15,000 former combatants and abductees of the LRA have taken advantage of the law. To obtain an amnesty certificate, the ex-combatant must sign a declaration denouncing the rebellion. In exchange, the recipient also receives a resettlement package, which includes a lump sum of 263,000 Uganda shillings (US $150), as well as a mattress, a blanket, a hoe and some seeds. ""I am hoping to use the money I will receive to go back to teacher-training school and eventually hope to return to the teaching profession I was in before I joined the war,"" Otim said. The law is retrospective, with the amnesty dating back to 26 January 1986, when the government of President Yoweri Museveni came to power. Males and females over the age of 12 who were in captivity or combat for more than four months are eligible. The LRA, led by the elusive and self-proclaimed mystic Joseph Kony, has waged a brutal campaign against the government for the past 19 years. The UN estimates that the insurgents have abducted more than 20,000 children to fight in the war and killed tens of thousands of civilians in the northern and eastern regions of the country. The journey to forgiveness Josephine Ajara, now 21, was abducted by the LRA in 1996 as she and her family sat down to breakfast one morning. ""First, I was forced to raid IDP [internally displaced persons'] camps for food. After a few months, I was taken to Sudan and became a soldier. I had to participate in the war,"" she explained. Ajara served as a private in Kony's army for four years until her escape in 2001. ""One day, Kony's spirit came over him and told him that 600 abductees would escape that day,"" she said. ""Three others and I decided to run away that day. We were followed by 50 soldiers, who had been told to chop us up into little pieces should they find us."" The UN Children's Fund returned Ajara from Juba, southern Sudan, to her home district of Kitgum, where she was handed over to the Ugandan army, who brought her to a reception centre for former abductees and combatants. She was later taken to the Kitgum branch of the Amnesty Commission. ""In the bush, we had heard about the amnesty, but Kony told us it was a lie and just a method of killing us when we came out,"" she said. ""We were told we would be killed with a slow poison when we came out - for months I was very careful about what I ate, fearing the government was trying to poison me."" Ajara received her resettlement package and opened a kiosk in Kitgum town with the money. She planted crops and now sells food to her neighbours in Labuje IDP camp, where she found her family upon her return. At Labuje, she was taken through ""mato oput"", a traditional Acholi justice ritual in which she accepted responsibility for her crimes and her family made reparations to the families of those she had harmed during her time as part of the rebellion. Afterwards, she was reintegrated into her community. However, Ajara said, most people had not really forgiven her. She has a three-month-old child whose father refused to marry her on the grounds that she had participated in the rebellion. ""Many people still think of me as a killer, and it is difficult for them to accept me back into the community,"" she observed. ""When the men get drunk, they even begrudge me the money I was given by the commission, saying their own innocent children have nothing while I, a killer, got government support."" Despite the horrors she was subjected to in the bush, Ajara said she firmly believed that Kony should be forgiven if he surrendered because it was ""the only way for us to get peace."" Challenges to amnesty Although more than 15,000 people have been granted amnesty under the act, a shortage of funds has meant only about 4,000 have received the resettlement package that should accompany it. ""Just 278 out of more than 1,800 amnesty cases in Kitgum district have received the packages,"" admitted Raphael Makoha, head of the Kitgum branch of the Amnesty Commission. ""We do not have the funds to give them when they return, and we do not have the capacity to follow them up and ensure they are getting on well when they leave us,"" he added. On 13 May, the World Bank launched the Uganda chapter of the Multi-Country Demobilisation and Resettlement Programme. The project - estimated at $4.2 million over a two-year period and intended to support the amnesty process - is expected to go a long way towards funding the backlog of cases, as well as helping future amnesty recipients. Stigma remains a huge challenge for former abductees and combatants. While they are accepted by their communities on a superficial level, they still endure abuse from their peers and are deeply mistrusted. More support was needed, Makoha indicated, for psychosocial therapy for returnees and local communities. ""We are trying to sensitise the communities, to tell them that most of these people were forced to commit these crimes. But stigma is difficult to overcome, especially where murder and other such atrocities are concerned,"" he said. Many abductees who were tortured or forced by the LRA to commit horrific crimes against civilians suffer from severe trauma. Although they receive some counselling at reception centres immediately after leaving the LRA, many continue to suffer from post-traumatic stress or other trauma-related disorders, effectively rendering them unable to function in normal society. ""It is difficult to put it out of my mind,"" Ajara said. ""The memories, the nightmares, they remain with me at night."" The amnesty programme was given an additional boost on 7 June when Museveni said Kony was entitled to immunity if he surrendered, in contrast to his previous statement that the LRA leadership should not be eligible. Ultimately, Onega maintained, the amnesty process has provided Uganda with a unique and affordable opportunity for a peaceful resolution of the conflicts that have ""torn the country into pieces"". « Waiting for elusive peace in the war-ravaged north"
Anxiety over peace in the south,"Josephine Mangera, 24, was a member of the choir that sang on Saturday at the burial of Sudan's First Vice President, John Garang, in the southern town of Juba. ""All we want now is peace,"" she said. ""I don't know much about Salva [Kiir Mayardit, Garang's successor], but I say to him - stick to the agreement and give us the peace."" For Alfred Sule, a 20-year-old Dinka man bearing traditional scarification on his face, Garang's death in a helicopter crash on 30 July marked a turning point in relations with Sudan's north. ""Now we want a free, Christian south,"" he said. Mangera and Sule may have been speaking out of emotion, but following Garang's death, many in southern Sudan reacted with a mixture of sorrow, anger, uncertainty and general resentment. In the capital, Khartoum, and in several southern towns such as Juba and Malakal, news of the crash triggered riots by southerners in which at least 130 people were killed. Garang was killed near the Uganda-Sudan border as he flew back to his base in New Site, southern Sudan, after a meeting with Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni. The Ugandan government-owned MI-72 helicopter came down in bad weather, killing all people on board. Until 9 January, when the SPLM/A signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) with Khartoum, Garang had led the southern Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) in a 21-year war against the Sudanese government. As part of the CPA, Garang was sworn into office as Sudan's First Vice-President on 9 July. ""It [Garang's death] has the potential to create turmoil,"" John Prendergast, a special advisor to the International Crisis Group, a global think tank, told IRIN. ""It is a setback to the CPA,"" he added. ""Garang was so central to the negotiations, and many of the provisions were his."" The CPA was signed in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, after several years of talks mediated by Lt Gen Lazarus Sumbeiywo, a retired Kenyan army officer. Sumbeiywo described Garang's death, as ""shocking, the loss of a visionary leader"". ""My prayer is that the Sudanese will remain level-headed,"" he told reporters in Nairobi. Sudan's President Umar al-Bashir has pledged to work with the SPLM/A to continue to implement the peace agreement. ""We are confident that the peace agreement will proceed,"" Bashir said on Sudanese television. According to analysts, Garang had always maintained that southern Sudan should remain politically joined to the north. In the south, his policy met with popular opposition, but it found support among northern rebel movements still fighting the Khartoum government. JUBA RIOTS Juba is the largest town in southern Sudan, and although under government control, it was the proposed administrative capital for the new SPLM/A-led southern Sudan government. Upon hearing news of the crash, gangs of marauding youths took to the streets, mainly targeting northern Arab traders. They looted shops and burnt down the market, prompting many of the traders to flee the town or seek refugee in army barracks. ""We have to get rid of the Arabs,"" Sule said as he walked through the ruins of shops in Juba market. The mayhem brought the garrison town of 40,000 to 80,000 northern troops to a standstill. Despite the government's imposition of a dusk-to-dawn curfew and its deployment of armed soldiers to patrol the streets, unrest persisted until after Garang's burial. The International Committee of the Red Cross in Juba said at least 18 people had died in the town during the week of riots. As traders fled aboard any available bus or car, Juba's transport system slowly ground to a halt. Many of the traders camped at the city's heavily guarded airport, hoping for a flight to take them to Khartoum. Several cargo planes that flew in from Khartoum ahead of Garang's state funeral carried back terrified traders and their families. ""We do not know why they are targeting us,"" one trader told reporters at the airport. ""We were not responsible [for the crash]."" ""I couldn't care less,"" Mangera said. ""The new SPLM/A leaders must move quickly to diffuse the tensions,"" a Nairobi-based analyst said. ""They must amplify the message that Rebecca [Garang's widow] has been shouting - that people must remain calm."" In Juba, however, people continued to discuss conspiracy theories. In whispers, they told each other the crash was no accident. As they awaited the report of a government-appointed inquiry into the crash, they continued to disbelieve statements from Khartoum that the crash was most likely an accident. Other analysts, however, said the SPLM/A needed to sort itself out quickly, assume leadership and bring hope to the south. ""Within the SPLM/A, there is a long history of divisions, and unless they can thrash out their differences quickly [...] some people, lone-rangers and spoilers who always felt left out, will try to exploit the situation,"" Prendergast said. Ahead of Kiir's swearing in as Sudan's First Vice President and President of southern Sudan on Thursday, the vice president of the southern Sudan government, Riek Machar, told reporters on Monday the SPLM/A had outstanding issues to settle. He said these included the naming of candidates to the government of national unity and to the national assembly, and the drafting of a constitution for southern Sudan. FINAL JOURNEY Garang was buried high on a hill on the outer edge of town, overlooking the lush green Jebel Kuyu mountains, in an emotional ceremony in which hundreds of volunteers carried bricks, shovelled sand and mixed cement under the supervision of SPLM/A architects who designed the mausoleum. Speaking at Juba cathedral, Archbishop Joseph Marona compared Garang to several biblical prophets, particularly Moses, for ""leading the people of Sudan towards peace and stability"". Kiir reiterated the southerners' commitment to the CPA. Bashir, speaking in Arabic, said he intended to continue implementing the letter, spirit and calendar of the CPA. In a final, customary Dinka tribute, a white bull was slaughtered next to the tomb in ""Garang gardens"". As the 21-cannon-salute resounded in the hills, the skies opened up and rain - considered a good omen in the Dinka tradition - showered the crowd. ""The rain may have been a good omen, but for the tension to die down, the people here need to see tangible signs that Garang's vision has remained alive and strong,"" an aid worker in Juba said on Tuesday. ""For that they need some kind of reassurance that peace is here to stay,"" he added. ""Juba is calm since the burial, but plenty of anxiety runs below the surface."""
Special reports on peace prospects in Sudan,"This is the first of five reports on prospects for peace in the Sudan. The remaining reports will be published over the next two months// For the first time in years, many dare to hope that the 20-year civil war in Sudan, which has claimed the lives of at least two million people and forced millions of others from their homes, may end soon. Sudan's warring parties have spent the last 18 months discussing how to stop fighting and build peace in their country. After a break of a few weeks, they are to resume their discussions on 17 February, in what analysts say could mark the last stage of peace negotiations and lead to the signing of a comprehensive agreement that should usher in a new era of peace and stability in the East Africa country. In a series of five in-depth articles, IRIN focuses on the implications of the prospective peace agreement between the government of Sudan and the main rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). The series, which will be published over a two-month period, examines the prospects for stability in Sudan once the peace agreement is signed. The first article provides an overview of the Sudanese situation. Others will focus on the continuing conflict in Darfur, internal displacement, humanitarian access and the spill-over of refugees into Chad; the perspectives of various sectors in the north, west and south on prospects for lasting peace; and a regional assessment of what the proposed peace deal would mean for Sudan’s neighbours, such as Uganda and Eritrea. Report one: Background to the peace process"
Rwandan asylum seekers denied refugee status,"At least 1,100 Rwandans who fled their country in recent months and sought asylum in neighbouring Uganda have been denied refugee status and advised to return home, officials said on Friday. ""We were not convinced by the reasons they gave during our interviews. They told us that they came to Uganda looking for land and they were citing property wrangles back home,"" David Kazungu, Uganda's assistant commissioner for refugees, said. ""Many said they were told that there is plenty of land in Uganda and they decided to come in. We would not grant them refugee status and we have encouraged them to return home,"" he added. He said, however, that the refugee eligibility committee had found 80 of the asylum seekers ""with well-founded fears of persecution"". The Rwandans recently fled Omutara, Gitarama, Vyumba and Kibungo provinces in Rwanda, and have since been living in southwestern Uganda, near the refugee settlement of Nakivale. The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, confirmed Uganda’s refusal to accord the Rwandans refugee status, and said the process did not contravene any international convention. ""The process was done under internationally acceptable standards and was very transparent. Two of our refugee protection officers participated in the screening exercise and we are satisfied with the way it was carried out,"" Roberta Russo, UNHCR spokeswoman in Kampala, said. Kazungu said the rejected asylum seekers, mainly women and children, had 90 days to appeal the decision. Russo said UNHCR was ready to support both the government and the asylum seekers during the review period: ""We shall provide legal help and counselling,"" she said. Uganda hosts an estimated 14,000 Rwandan refugees, living mainly in settlements in the west. Some 1,500 arrived in the country more recently, citing persecution in Rwanda. Relief workers in April said some Rwandans had fled out fear of arrest and prosecution under Rwanda's traditional justice system, known as ""Gacaca"". Gacaca courts began operating across Rwanda in March as part of the government's efforts to clear the regular national courts' massive backlog of cases relating to the country's 1994 genocide. Nearly one in 10 of Rwanda's eight million people face charges stemming from the genocide, according to official estimates. An estimated 10,000 have to date been tried before national courts. Based on a traditional village model of delivering justice, the Gacaca courts have the power to acquit or convict people accused of participation in the genocide, and to hand down sentences ranging from community service to life imprisonment."
Refugees and asylum seekers subjected to human rights abuses,"Afghan refugees in neighbouring countries and further afield continue to suffer human rights violations, rights advocates warned the Afghan government on Wednesday. Their concerns follow recent reports that Greek police officers allegedly tortured a group of some 40 Afghan asylum-seekers, including at least 17 Afghans aged 15 to 17. The torture reportedly included severe beatings and death threats, taking place over several days in mid-December, according to Amnesty International (AI). ""The human rights violations of Afghan refugees outside the country continue to be a matter of concern. We have called on the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs to look after this issue through their channels,"" Nader Nadery, a member of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), told IRIN in the capital, Kabul. The commission emphasised that the forced repatriation of Afghan refugees from various countries and a cessation of their refugee status was contrary to international refugee protection standards. According to Nadery, under international standards for returnees' protection, Afghanistan was still not a secure place for return. ""The major concern is not only their safety in terms of security but also their food and shelter security,"" adding that the post-conflict Afghan government was not able to provide enough jobs and health care, while housing continued to pose a major problem for returnees. The rights advocate said incidents reported included the harassment of refugees by police and other authorities, mainly in Iran and Pakistan, the issue of the reunification of refugees with their families in Australia, the status of Afghan asylum seekers on the Pacific island of Nauru, as well as the alleged beating and torture of Afghan refugees by Greece police. Meanwhile, the Afghan Commission for Human Rights (ACHR) told IRIN that hundreds of Afghan refugees in some Central Asian countries, as well as Russia, were tortured by police, with some falling victim to mafia gangs. ""Unfortunately we continue to see Afghans severely harassed by police and mafia bands in Central Asia as they take this route to go to Europe,"" Lal Gul, ACHR's chairman told IRIN. In Russia there were two problems. Firstly, the unclear fate of thousands of Afghan refugees who lacked proper support and status, while the other was the plight of Afghans that had lived there earlier as students during the time of the Soviet Union, he explained, only to fall victim to drugs or harassment by the authorities later on. ""They were children when they were sent to Russia. Now they have lost track of their families in Afghanistan and also their mother language. The have no clear destiny since the collapse of the Soviet Union,"" Gul noted. Abdul Ghafour Basim, another rights advocate, told IRIN from the northeastern city of Pul-e-Khumri that the rate of torture and even murder of Afghans by police and mafia was high in Russia, adding that his own son had been killed by the Russian police while attempting to defend the rights of Afghan refugees. ""Abdul Hamid Basim, 38, was killed on 2 October by police in Leningrad. Investigations showed he was severely beaten and tortured after he was arrested,"" said Basim, responsible for the Afghan Organisation of Human Rights and Environmental Protection (AOHREP) northeastern sub office. The activist said his son was the seventh Afghan killed by Russian police and mafia groups in 2004. Gul said ACHR had information that hundreds of Afghans were in custody in Asian, European and Gulf states. ""For example, more than 45 percent of the Afghans in Pakistan prisons are children and women who have fallen victim of drug mafias due to poverty and problems of life in exile,"" Gul said. But nearly three years after the fall of the hard-line Taliban regime, conditions in Afghanistan still do not allow for the return of millions of Afghans still residing outside the country. While more than three million Afghan refugees have returned home from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran since then, millions remain in exile, citing a lack of security, law and order, as well as poverty due to a persistent drought."
Re-registration of refugees and asylum seekers proceeding well,"In a joint exercise by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Tajik government, efforts to re-register some 3,000 refugees and asylum seekers in the Central Asian state - the vast majority of them Afghan - are proceeding well. ""Tajikistan's protection climate has improved considerably in the past years,"" Nicholas Coussidis, UNHCR representative in Tajikistan told IRIN in the capital, Dushanbe, on Wednesday. ""This re-registration undertaking is a further manifestation of joint efforts with the aim of protecting and assisting refugees and seeking durable solutions for their future."" His comments came two days after the UN refugee agency and Tajikistan's State Migration Service (SMS) began a wholesale registration and re-validation of all refugees and asylum seekers in the mountainous former Soviet republic. The exercise aims to collect and verify available information of these individuals, as well as provide them with identification documents. Although the SMS had previously registered many refugees and asylum seekers, many of its recordings had not followed a standardised electronic format, making data updating and processing a cumbersome process and leading to possible problems due to incomplete or expired refugee documentation. But it was the improved protection climate in the country that UNHCR prefers to emphasise the most now. Gone are the days when tens of thousands of asylum-seekers fled neighbouring Afghanistan, clustering on the deserted islands of the border river of Panj and crowding towns and markets up north. And while the improving situation inside Afghanistan has encouraged many of these people to return home, more than 9,000 with UNHCR assistance alone, continuing uncertainty and security concerns has resulted in some to remain in Tajikistan, forming a productive community of an estimated 3,000 people. As part of their protection and assistance needs, as well as helping the Tajik authorities in building a functioning refugee protection system, a critical element of UNHCR's refugee protection system is the registration and processing of data on persons of concern. The exercise, which began on Monday, was preceded by months of preparation. The UNHCR-sponsored database software was translated into Russian and adapted to the specific needs of the SMS and the UNHCR persons of concern in Tajikistan. UNHCR through its implementing partners conducted a massive outreach campaign explaining to the refugee population the necessity of registration and the procedure to be followed by SMS officials. Information provided by refugees and their digital photographs will be entered into a database and analysed and updated as necessary. The refugees and asylum seekers will supply this information during personal interviews scheduled to take place over a span of three weeks in Dushanbe and in northern Khujand, the second largest city in the country. Individuals residing outside these cities, as well as those with special needs, are offered the option of home interviews. Once completed, the database will be owned and operated by the SMS, whose officials were trained by UNHCR. The refugee agency will have unrestricted access to the information, but the database will remain confidential. This effort represents a further step in UNHCR’s long-standing relationship with Dushanbe. As noted by Coussidis, the country's protection climate had improved considerably over the past year and this re-registration undertaking was a further exchange of joint efforts with the aim of protecting and assisting refugees, as well as seeking durable solutions for their future. Initial analysis of the data was expected to be available in late March, an agency statement read on Monday."
Focus on Afghan refugees,"While much is known about the status of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, the two largest host countries to the Afghan diaspora, little is known about those in neighbouring Tajikistan, where some 3,000 currently reside. Ask them what they want though the answer will most likely be the same. ""I don't want to return to Afghanistan. I want to be resettled,"" Rahima Sakhidod, a 38-year-old, told IRIN in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe. ""There is no future for me here."" Arriving from the northern Afghan city of Konduz 12 years ago following the death of her husband, she yearns to begin a new life outside of Tajikistan, preferably in North America or Western Europe. ""I don't care where I'm resettled,"" the mother-of-four said matter-of-factly. ""I just want to go to a country where I can educate my children."" Her friend Qudisay Mohammad Naim agreed. ""If I had wanted to return to Afghanistan, I would have gone already,"" the mother-of-five from the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif concurred. ""We have enemies there. It's not safe for me or my family,"" the 34-year-old told IRIN, who fled to Tajikistan during the Afghan presidency of Mohammed Najibullah. Most Afghans arrived in the mountainous Central Asian state of 6.5 million in the early to mid 1990s, after the fall of the Najibullah regime, while a good number came after the Taliban took over. CURRENT CASELOAD OF AFGHAN REFUGEES According to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), many of these individuals had been processed and had refugee status, though there were some persons whose status had yet to be confirmed, and who consequently were referred to as asylum seekers. And while more than 2.5 million Afghan refugees have returned to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries since the collapse of the Taliban government in late 2001, the chances of seeing any sizeable return from Tajikistan, which shares over 1,200 km of common frontier with the beleaguered nation, remains minimal. Their status in the impoverished nation is actually better than most Afghans living elsewhere. ""In many ways they feel at home here,"" Nicholas Coussidis, representative for UNHCR in Tajiksitan told IRIN in Dushanbe. And with the vast majority of them being of Tajik ethnicity, it's not hard to understand why. ""There is definitely an informal integration of Afghans taking place, much more common as found in Pakistan and Iran,"" the UNHCR official explained, noting many were in mixed marriages, worked or had businesses, while some of their children attended local schools. But that has not always been the case, with reported incidents of discrimination, particularly when it came to employment, as well as cases of detentions and deportations due to expired documentation. ""There was no proper status determination procedure. There was not very positive refugee legislation,"" Coussidis explained. POSITIVE PROTECTION CLIMATE That attitude has changed immensely, however, over recent years, a fact Coussidis was quick to point out. ""This negative protection climate has changed,"" he stressed, adding authorities in the former Soviet republic had understood the issue, noting any unnecessary hard line failed to serve any one's purpose. ""From the very top to our counterparts in the Ministry of Labour and state migration services, the authorities have a very positive outlook and attitude towards Afghans - not just because they are the majority [of the refugee community] - but all other asylum seekers as well."" THE ROAD AHEAD But challenges still remain. Mavjuda Rakhmanova, the director of the Dushanbe-based Refugee Children and Vulnerable Citizens (RCVC), a local Tajik NGO working to assist refugees and asylum seekers, cited legislation, current registration procedures, jobs and housing, as the main problems Afghans had in Tajikistan now. ""The main problem Afghans face in Tajikistan today is the current legislation. This should be changed in accordance to international norms and standards,"" she revealed.

Citing resolution 325 restricting the residency of asylum seekers in Tajikistan, she noted that Afghans were prohibited to reside in some 15 cities and towns in Tajikistan, including the capital and Khujand. ""This is for asylum seekers who came to Tajikistan after 2000,"" Rakhmanova said, noting those coming after 2000 were to be settled in rural areas only. And while refugees had the same rights as Tajik citizens to work, once an employer learnt they were Afghan, they were not keen to offer them jobs, the NGO worker told IRIN, noting the problem of employment was particularly profound amongst women, many of whom traditionally would not work if they were in Afghanistan. According to the UNHCR, they were now in the process of amending the current refugee legislation to reflect the 1951 Convention and international instruments, while at the same time, efforts were now under way with the authorities for finding solutions, starting with the registration revalidation and updating activity, status reviewals, and documents being extended accordingly. ""By doing this, we can determine who is in the need of protection, and who is not,"" Coussidis said. Describing the current atmosphere as good, he remarked: ""The protection climate and the overall attitude of the authorities is very positive. We have gone beyond dialogue and really have a constructive process with the authorities."" There are currently some 3,000 refugees and asylum seekers in Tajikistan today, almost all of whom are Afghans, along with a small handful of Iraqis, Iranians and Uighurs. ""The registration revalidation and updating activity is not just for the Afghans, but for any refugee or asylum seeker in the country, irrespective of their place of origin,"" the UNHCR official said. Set to begin in February 2004, the hope is to have a complete profile of refugees and asylum seekers in Tajikistan as much as possible. ""This is our policy - in full support and collaboration with the authorities,"" he noted. At present, the vast majority of Afghan refugees live in Dushanbe, as well as a small amount - approximately 250 -living in the northern city Khujand, where economic conditions in the impoverished nation are somewhat better than rural areas. ""For refugees, life is more secure in the cities,"" RCVC's Rakhmanova added. This unto itself undoubtedly plays a role in impacting their decision to return to Afghanistan. A largely urban caseload, most Afghans living in Tajikistan come from a middle-class, professional background, ie traders and merchants. ""We don't have the more traditional type Afghan refugee that you find in Pakistan and Iran -the farmer and the peasant,"" Coussidis said, noting most today would get by mainly in small trade.

Citing insecurity, along with political and economic uncertainty, he noted, despite offering the same assistance package to returning Afghans from Pakistan and Iran, returns right now were not something they expected in large numbers. In 2003, 143 Afghans from Tajikistan returned to their homeland with UNHCR assistance. ""Once they are back in Afghanistan, they receive a small monetary grant to facilitate their return to their place of origin,"" he said, emphasising that the repatriation package Afghans in Tajikistan receive is exactly the same as those returning from other countries. ""It’s a standardised process."" CONCLUSION But for most Afghans interviewed by IRIN, the decision to return to their homeland looks remote. Most seek resettlement or to simply staying where they are. Many of them think moving to America, Canada or Europe would provide solutions, but resettlement was first and foremost a protection tool, Katja Storch, a protection officer for UNHCR in Dushanbe, told IRIN. Meanwhile, many Afghans, like Rahima Sakhidod and Qudisay Mohammad Naim, continue to worry what fate might befall them if they returned given their family's connection to former Afghan president Mohammed Najibullah. ""We have enemies there. It's not safe for me,"" Sakhidod exclaimed. But while the current government in Afghanistan is unlikely to have anything against them, their fears are more on a personal basis, as opposed to an institutional one, perhaps in the form of old vendettas. Such concerns, however, only serve to support the need to find more durable solutions to the Afghan caseload of Tajikistan. ""We need to look at other solutions,"" Coussidis maintained, including the possibility of resettlement for those who really deserve it, including the usual criteria of security, single headed households, health related issues and protection concerns. Still another solution is local integration. ""This is not an easy one for a number of reasons, but this is something we are looking into,"" he ascertained. ""It's not an overnight issue,"" he said, adding it was a small number with a potential to contribute quite a lot to Tajik society."
Focus on Iraqi refugees,"In a tent in the middle of the dusty desert landscape in soaring temperatures on the Jordanian/Iraqi border, an Iraqi refugee stands pumping iron in a makeshift gym to the rhythm of the latest Western pop songs. ""Come and join us,"" he shouts, pointing to what looks like an extremely heavy dumb bell. The refugee spends most of his days at the al-Ruweished camp, some 350 km east of the Jordanian capital, Amman, perfecting his physique. Next to him stands another refugee, of a smaller build, but still very toned. ""Would you like me to cut your hair?"" he asks, pointing to the makeshift hairdressing salon in the tent next door. The camp was established following the 2003 US-led war in Iraq when thousands of people fled to various neighbouring countries in search of safety. Looking around the fenced camp, some 3 sq km of land, now home to 152 people living in tarpaulin tents, it is clear that a tiny village has emerged. Residents do not want to return to their homeland because they feel it is not safe. Most of the refugees are Palestinians who settled in Iraq to escape the fighting in their own country, but left when the war started in March 2003. While the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said that the country is not safe to return to, it will facilitate returns for those who are desperate to go back and have difficulties crossing an often dangerous border. Between April and July 2004, 226 Palestinians went back to Iraq, provided with an assistance package of non-food items, as well as a cash grant to cover transport and accommodation to last until the end of the year. However, repatriation from the camps has almost stopped now, with only one refugee repatriating in August and only one so far in September, according to UNHCR. TENTED VILLAGE With insecurity inside Iraq, camp residents say they are trying to make the most of their stay in the dry and extreme conditions at al-Ruweished and it was clear to see that aid agencies were doing their best to make life as comfortable as possible for them, catering for the young and old, men and women. At one side of the camp, there is a mother and baby centre, funded by the international NGO, CARE. There is a flurry inside as groups of women gather for a chat along with their children who play happily with toys and other toddlers. ""Our living conditions were better in Iraq, but we can't go back there now,"" Ferdose Idid, 34, a refugee from Somalia who was living in Iraq, told IRIN at al-Ruweished. Together with her four children, she spends her days in the centre thinking about how and where she will go next. ""I don't want to stay here forever. It is not the best solution for me and my family,"" she added, while adjusting her bright blue headscarf. ""Life is hard here. There are snakes and scorpions, which can get into our tents easily,"" Omaira Raghib, another female refugee, told IRIN. ""Weather conditions are bad all the time, either too hot or too cold. Winter is about to start and we need proper housing,"" she complained. ""We are tired or moving around now and we want peace,"" she added. PREPARATIONS FOR WINTER Enduring a second winter at the camp is particularly nerve wracking for some. ""Winter is coming and it's going to be tough. I hope the weak ones can survive,"" said one elderly refugee. ""In order to assist refugees to the extent possible, a range of measures will be implemented: winter clothing will be distributed, the kerosene ration will be doubled to provide sufficient fuel for heating/cooking stoves and additional non-food items will be distributed,"" head of the UNHCR in Jordan, Sten Bronee, told IRIN from Amman. A survey was underway to determine which additional non-food items refugees would be needed for the coming winter, he added. ACTIVITIES AND ASSISTANCE ON OFFER Back in the mother and baby centre, children are kept busy and their activities are visible as the walls are covered with brightly painted pictures. They also receive education there, offered through the Jordanian government and supported by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The operation of the camps was agreed upon between UNHCR and the Jordanian authorities in April. It allows the refugee agency to ""provide accommodation to those Iraqi and other nationals in need of temporary protection, pending longer-term and durable solutions, in particular the safe return to their country of origin or habitual residence or resettlement in third countries,"" the agreement says. Refugees are provided with food on a regular basis, which includes daily fresh bread, fruit, eggs and yoghurt. Complementary food such as tinned meat, canned sardines, beans, lentils, rice, oil, tea, sugar and salt are distributed every three weeks. Powdered milk and biscuits are also provided. In addition, families are given 80 litres of kerosene per month during the winter months for cooking and heating. This ration is halved during the summer. Personal hygiene items such as shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrushes, razors, detergent and soap are regularly distributed. Potable water is provided daily by tanker with a minimum of 20 litres per person per day during the winter months. This ration is doubled in summer. The camp is managed by the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation (JHCO) on behalf of Amman. It has established a clinic to deal with any medical problems on site. According to a Dr Ehsam there were no serious cases at present. ""If we have any difficult cases we refer them to the hospital in Amman,"" he explained proudly, pointing to a cabinet full of basic medicines. ""In general the situation is relatively calm here and the refugees are well looked after. Their needs are catered for,"" Mohammed Al-Kuda, camp manager from the JHCO, told IRIN at al-Ruweished. ""However, they are under a lot of stress. They have been here for a very long time and weather conditions are severe. It is extremely hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter,"" he explained. In order to help relieve such symptoms a range of recreational activities for both adults and children are organised. There are libraries, handicrafts, football, painting, sewing, singing, chess, table tennis and even a television. This is in addition to vocational training such as welding, carpentry, mechanics and sewing. Despite all the help and facilities on offer, it has now been more than a year since the first refugee arrived from Iraq and many say they are tired of their situation, hoping for peace in their homeland, peace that looks a long way off given the current insecurity. NO-MAN'S-LAND Some 80 km from al-Ruweished, on the border with Iraq in no-man's-land, there is another camp. This one is home to some 1,000 refugees, mainly Iranian Kurds. Again unable to return to Iraq or home to Iran, most claim to be political opponents of their government. They say they are waiting for a permanent solution. ""We want resettlement,"" Malka Chirghi, told IRIN in no-man's-land. ""These conditions are unbearable,"" she added, clutching her baby covered in dust. These refugees are provided with similar assistance to those in al-Ruweished along with the same primary health care services, dental treatment and psycho-social assistance. This camp, too, has become a small fenced village and some refugees have even resorted to creating a mini oasis outside their tents by growing ferns, herbs and fruit such as melons. Most residents here are able to speak English and informal primary education including subjects such as maths, Persian, English and Kurdish is offered. Outside the camp, there is a hive of activity at the border customs office. Queues of cars are seen lining up to enter or leave Iraq. The most common sight is lines of heavy goods vehicles carrying second hand cars to be sold in Iraq. But this gives little hope to people in the camp. ""Look outside, there is no work for us here. We feel useless,"" Mustafa Karim, a refugee, told IRIN, while raising his hands in despair. ""We are stuck here in the middle of nowhere,"" he added. The majority of the refugees here are adamant about what they want. ""We want to leave this place and live in peace. We want to live abroad in Europe,"" Shirin, 12, told IRIN. ""Without doubt, all the refugees would want third country resettlement,"" Bronee said. ""However, only those refugees meeting specific criteria are submitted for resettlement,"" he added. This year 879 individuals from the two camps have been submitted to resettlement countries, including the US, Australia and Nordic nations. Of these, Sweden has recently accepted 384 Iranian Kurds, according to UNHCR. Focus on Iraqi refugees - photo gallery"
Refugees released on bail,"Six refugees charged with incitement to public violence in Namibia were released on Wednesday on Nam $500 (US $80) bail. The six, all Congolese nationals, were arrested on Tuesday and charged with ""incitement to public violence, resisting arrest and obstructing police officers from executing their duties"", police spokesman chief inspector Angula Amulungu confirmed. They are members of the Association for the Defence of Refugee Rights (ADR), based in Osire refugee camp about 300 km north of the capital, Windhoek. The arrest followed an attempted protest during World Refugee Day celebrations on Monday, when the refugee group waved placards accusing the authorities of violating their rights by allegedly denying them refugee status. The country's refugee commissioner has cited a lack of manpower as the reason for the delay in processing their asylum requests. The National Society for Human Rights (NSHR) has condemned the arrests and accused the government of ""ignoring"" the constitution, which guarantees the rights of refugees to express their concerns. ""We are dismayed over the arrests, which we feel will contribute to xenophobia in the country. We call on the UN refugee agency to ensure that the rights of all refugees are safeguarded,"" NSHR Executive Director Phil ya Nangoloh told IRIN."
Ahwazi refugees overlooked by government,"Hundreds of Ahwazi refugees in southern Iraq are living in deteriorating conditions, with little access to basic services such as education and healthcare, say UN officials. According to a report released in early November by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, there are some 2,500 refugees from the Iranian city of Ahwaz currently in Iraq. They are mainly concentrated in the south, in rural areas near Dujail, a majority Shi’ite city 80km south of the capital, Baghdad. Most Ahwazi refugees sought asylum in Iraq after fleeing neighbouring Iran, where they were accused by the government of serving as Iraqi fifth columnists during the ruinous Iran-Iraq war that lasted throughout much of the 1980s. “People just came to my house and told us that we had 24 hours to leave Ahwaz,” recalled 31-year old Salah Ali, who now lives in an empty government building near Dujail. In Iraq, however, with prevailing insecurity, conditions for the Ahwazis have worsened. The UNHCR report highlights dismal living conditions faced by most Ahwazis, who often live in abandoned government buildings and empty schools with little or no access to potable water or electricity. ""Most Ahwazi refugees are either living in public buildings or mud houses that lack water, electricity and sewage services, the report reads. The smell of open sewage in these make-shift dwellings, the report adds, is pervasive. The report also goes on to state that most public buildings will almost certainly be repossessed by the government in the future, and also remain at risk from mines and unexploded ordnance. Ziad Kardash, 27, an Ahwazi who lives in an abandoned school in Dujail, said that several of his close relatives had been injured by unexploded ordinance. “If we leave, we’ll have nowhere to go, but if we stay, we could be the next victims,” said Kardash. The report also notes that the lack of healthcare has resulted in widespread malnutrition among children. “My son is seriously sick because we don’t have enough food,” said Ali. “Sometimes we have to divide the same plate of rice between more than 10 people.” In an effort to prevent a further deterioration of the health situation, the Iraq Red Crescent Society (IRCS) recently announced it would form a committee to study the case of the refugees and prepare to send medical supplies. Ahwazis, meanwhile, complain that the current Iraqi government is indifferent to their plight. “We don’t know where to go,” said Kardash. “When we go to other governorates, they just tell us it’s not their problem and that it is best for us to leave the country.” Government officials, however, point out the difficulties involved in offering refuge in an already poor and war-torn country. “If we give residence permits to all of them, we’ll have more foreigners in our country than Iraqis,” said Maj Omar Lattif, a senior official in the department for residency claims. “We need time to study all the cases. We can’t just give residency permits to anyone who comes to our office,” he added. During the Saddam Hussein era, Ahwazi refugees were provided with homes and monthly food rations. Because of their association with the former regime, however, Ahwazis now often face discrimination and harassment. “My boss fired me after he found out I was Ahwazi,” Ali said. “He said Ahwazis don’t deserve money from Iraqis because we were Saddam’s helpers.” The UNHCR report notes that 80 Ahwazi families were forced out of their homes recently by supporters of the current Iraqi government. These families, the report adds, were subsequently relocated to a transit centre on the outskirts of Basra City."
Two Sudanese refugees killed in refugee camp,"Two Sudanese refugees were killed in Farchana Camp, eastern Chad, after Chadian government forces entered the camp to search for weapons following a riot on the 13 July, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) announced in a statement. Thursday’s statement confirmed that the body of a man and a woman had been taken from the camp, though it was not clear whether the two were killed during the intervention by the Chadian forces. IRIN attempted to contact Chadian ministers by telephone for confirmation, without success. Farchana camp lies 100km east of Abeche, close to the Sudanese border and the troubled Darfur region. Aid workers told IRIN on the day of the rioting in Farchana Camp, that the unrest was sparked when a Japanese environment agency asked the refugees to plant trees. The refugees opposed the move, seeing it as an attempt to keep them in camps instead of speeding up their return. Two aid workers were injured in the ensuing panic and later evacuated to the Abeche Hospital. Three days later, riots erupted in the Breidjing Camp, 30 km from Farchana, when CARE International employees carrying out sanitation work were attacked by refugees who mistakenly thought they were spies sent by the government of Khartoum. On Monday, Chadian authorities barred humanitarian organisations from entering either of the camps, which between them host more than 40,000 refugees as the situation has become too volatile. However, this has led to a deterioration in conditions, said aid workers, as water distribution, sanitation work, food and shelter distribution and the provision of medical care have ground to a halt. The local authorities are discussing with the refugees to see if agreements can be made to allow the humanitarian workers back on the camps. But, according to UNHCR officials, progress has been hindered by the conflicting views and demands of the refugee representatives. Chad is currently host to 180,000 Sudanese refugees who fled atrocities in Sudan’s western Darfur region."
Interview with refugee activist on returns,"The Islamabad-based Society for the Protection of Human Rights and Prisoners' Aid (SHARP) has been providing legal assistance to refugees and asylum seekers since 1999. With the start of Afghan repatriation in 2002, SHARP has been running the Advice and Legal Aid Centres (ALACs) in the province of Punjab to help returnees with legal and protection issues. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been assisting the voluntary repatriation of Afghans since 2002 under a tripartite agreement between Pakistan, Afghanistan and the refugee agency, which runs till March 2006. In the past three years, UNHCR has assisted nearly 2.3 million Afghans to return from Pakistan and anticipates a further 400,000 will repatriate during 2005. This week, Islamabad announced it would launch a comprehensive census of all Afghans in the country later in February. Some refugees and activists view the census as the prelude to the start of the forced return of Afghans, as Pakistan tries to find a long-term solution for the more than a million Afghans on its soil. In an interview with IRIN, Syed Liaquat Banori, chairman of SHARP, stressed the need to encourage ""sustainable repatriation"" of Afghans, instead of coercing them into returning early to a country that, he said, cannot sustain large numbers of returnees at present. QUESTION: Three years after the collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Islamabad now feels it is time for the more than one million Afghans left in the country to start going home. Should the government of Pakistan go beyond the support of voluntary repatriation? ANSWER: I don't think so. Afghanistan's administrative, physical, social and legal structure collapsed during the last two decades of conflict. No country damaged to this extent could recover overnight. If it took 25 years to destroy the country then it will require decades to rehabilitate it completely along with huge investment and funding. Given these circumstances, if Afghan refugees were repatriated forcefully, then the massive influx could create unrest and a big problem of law and order inside the country. The country is simply not at a stage of development where it can support a big return. It has enough to worry about trying to cope with the large number of IDPs [internally displaced people] that it is trying to help return to where they used to live. Q: You work extensively with Afghan refugees. What are they telling you about repatriation? A: I can say that most are very much willing to go back [to Afghanistan] provided they get respectable earning opportunities and shelter over there. Most are very poor and do not have much resources to build houses and start life again immediately after repatriating. The international community should address these concerns at the earliest. Secondly, Afghans are very concerned about the security situation inside Afghanistan. The Afghan government is still struggling to establish its authority beyond the capital. While this is happening, warlords, private militias, ordinary criminals, armed religious extremists and others opposed to [president Hamid] Karzai, make the country a very dangerous place. Q: Islamabad says the forthcoming Afghan census will help it formulate a humane repatriation policy. Do you agree? A: There is no formal data or statistics about the actual number of Afghan refugees living in Pakistan, so the UNHCR [the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] and the government of Pakistan have jointly decided to have a census later this month. But the census mechanism needs improvement. Accurate data is very much in the interest of Pakistan, the UNHCR and the international community. What is needed, is to ensure that whatever statistics we get at the end of the day, they should be reliable and helpful in formulating future policies. Q: Is there a need for greater international support in assisting with returns? A: The international community must help refugees living in Pakistan and also accelerate reconstruction efforts inside Afghanistan. Pakistan is a developing country. International donors and other agencies should help public service institutions in collaboration with the Pakistani government so once the Afghans repatriate back to their homeland, institutions can be utilised by our own poor communities. This two-pronged strategy would benefit refugees as well as local communities. Q: What can be done to boost repatriation numbers in 2005? A: Before making any effort to send refugees back, they should be prepared for future challenges. They should be properly trained in skills to help them to rebuild their country and reintegrate into Afghan society. This aspect has [so far] been missing in the strategies of UNHCR and the Pakistani government. We need to keep in mind that this repatriation is not happening for the first time. It happened in 1992 as well, but due to civil war inside Afghanistan, people came back. But this time we have to ensure a sustainable repatriation even if it is at a low pace, for one simple reason. If it is not successful, then Pakistan will be the ultimate loser as no doubt they would all just come back into Pakistan. As a human rights activist, I believe the time is not right for forced or coerced returns and that Pakistan has extended hospitality to such a large refugee population for over two decades and we can sustain them for three more years - or until Afghanistan is more developed and stable."
Broad agreement on Turkish refugee repatriation reached,"A broad agreement was reached on Friday between Turkey, Iraqi officials and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on a plan for the organised voluntary return of hundreds of Turkish refugees of Kurdish origin in Iraq to their homeland. The repatriations will be carried out under conditions of safety and dignity, according to the agreement. ""The next step is that the parties will go through their own processes to sign the agreement. This means the text will go to government authorities in Turkey and Iraq to be approved and signed,"" spokesman for UNHCR in Turkey, Metin Corabatir told IRIN in the Turkish capital, Ankara on Friday. ""It's difficult to say how soon repatriations will take place as there would be a mass information campaign before this,"" he added. With some 13,000 Turkish Kurds living in northern Iraq, the need for a large scale repatriation plan was essential, officials maintain. Most of them live in the Mahmour camp in the southeast of the northern governorate of Arbil, home to some 9,200 refugees, with the rest residing in cities. The Turkish Kurdish refugees are the third largest group of refugees in Iraq. They fled their homes in southeastern Turkey in the early 1990s following conflicts between the Turkish army and Kurdish rebels in which thousands were killed. The refugees first settled in Atrush, where two camps were established in the southwest of Dahuk in northern Iraq until they were moved to the Mahmour camp in 1998 by the government of Saddam Hussein. The camp is maintained by UNHCR, which supplied residents with basic provisions and shelter. Up until now there was no framework for a voluntary repatriation en masse of the refugees from northern Iraq. Participating in the second round of three day talks were the visiting US Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration, Arthur Dewey, the United Nations Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees Kamel Morjane, the Iraqi Minister of Displacement and Migration Muhammed Jassim Khudayir and senior Turkish officials. The first round of talks also took place in Ankara on 20 November and since then the officials had been working closely to reach this agreement. Since the end of the second Gulf war earlier this year, some 45 Turkish refugees assisted by UNHCR have returned home. In total the refugee agency has helped 2,200 refugees to return home to Turkey since 1997."
Interview with Turkish Ambassador to Iraq,"Turkey is determined to improve relations with and continue humanitarian work in neighbouring Iraq, despite the rejection last year of Turkish troop deployment by the US-appointed Iraqi Governing Council. In an interview with IRIN, Turkey's Ambassador to Iraq, Osman Paksüt, said that although his country had offered humanitarian assistance it was becoming increasingly difficult to deliver it because of the poor security situation. He also highlighted the difficulties of conducting official business in the absence of well-established administrative structures on the Iraqi side. QUESTION: What sorts of humanitarian activities are you carrying out in Iraq? ANSWER: The security situation is hampering our humanitarian activities. Travelling around is dangerous for anyone. For example, you saw the Bulgarian president was shot at the other day as his convoy was travelling somewhere around Najaf [holy city in southern Iraq]. Poor security even lead to the cancellation of a trade fare due to be held in Baghdad. Now it has been switched to Turkey. Unless the situation improves, reconstruction work and humanitarian work cannot go forward. Q: What are the immediate tasks you will carry out in Iraq? A: Last year, we allocated US $5 million for humanitarian work. We wanted to build two hospitals. We started building one hospital in Baghdad, but we couldn't proceed as planned because of [poor] security. The second one, we wanted to build in Kirkuk. It was not approved by the administrators there. So we are a little bit frustrated with the way our assistance offer was met. But we sent humanitarian supplies to northern Iraq and to Baghdad. We also hope to do irrigation and potable water projects in Mosul in the future. Q: What sort of humanitarian role do you expect to play in Iraq? A: We re-allocated $50 million this year to be spent on health infrastructure and education. We will help universities here and send students on exchange programmes to universities in Turkey. We want to build hospitals in agreement with local authorities. But there still is confusion about who will be in charge after 30 June [when sovereignty is to be handed over to Iraqis]. We don't know who will give the approval to build a school or a hospital. It's no fault on our part, but we have to wait to see what the administrative infrastructure will be here. Basically, that's what prevents us from doing assistance and reconstruction at the moment. Security is also a problem, but the [current] loose governing structure is worse. People are appointed to various offices, but then they're removed and replaced. This makes it difficult for us. We don't know if the Transitional Administrative Law, or TAL [approved by US administrators and appointed government leaders on 15 November] will be implemented. The majority of Iraqis do not embrace it. In fact, we understand [UN and Iraq] representatives are negotiating to pass a United Nations Security Council resolution to adjust parts of the transitional law. They say there will be a caretaker government, but what will the caretaker government take care of? There's no point in rushing things on the ground, unless there's a dire humanitarian emergency [arising] from fighting [Coalition forces are currently battling insurgents in Fallujah and Najaf] or from an epidemic. We must plan more carefully and prepare projects with the right people and agencies. Q: What particular skills or expertise do you bring to the humanitarian effort? A: We have sent several dozens of Iraqi patients to Turkish hospitals - children wounded during the war and some chronically ill people. In one case, we sent 12 people by plane to Turkey who came back to Iraq after treatment. After the terrorist bombings in Arbil earlier this year we treated more than 40 people for burns and other wounds. Some of them are still in Turkey. Also, take the number of cancer incidents. The number is increasing, probably from depleted uranium. We don't have the World Health Organization here. It's a tragedy that the United Nations and humanitarian agencies can't work here. The number of cancer patients has doubled or tripled, but there's no reliable proof of what's causing their disease. Iraqis are saying they can treat them, but they probably don't have the capability or the expertise. Sometimes they reject the problem because they feel offended when we say we can help. Q: What will Turkey's top priority be in Iraq? A: We are able to help in many respects. We can improve the sanitary and water systems here. Construction [expertise] is more advanced in Turkey, so we offered to build a new road, for example, from a new [Turkey/Iraq] border gate to Mosul. Our project would include a border gate to the west of the current border gate and would pass through Talafar, a Shi'ite region in northern Iraq. This project was not agreed to on the Iraqi side. They said, just open the second gate and make the road go to Zakhou [a northern region between Mosul and the Turkish border]. From Khabur gate [the current Turkey/Iraq border crossing], our aim is to revitalise the economy of the Mosul region. They did not approach the idea warmly, however. Presently the road is controlled by the KDP [Kurdish Democratic Party]. The KDP are collecting taxes and fees. They say they can calculate what they owe to the central government and compensate them, but others aren't collecting the same kind of taxes. It is a source of income for the Kurdish authorities. I don't want to accuse them, but we couldn't agree on the road. It places an extra financial burden on Iraq if they don't accept our help, since it would cost $60 million to $90 million to build such a road. We could find financing for this project. It could be the World Bank or Turkish financing. There is also a project to build a railroad from Turkey south into Iraq, but it requires building the track. These are long-term projects. There should be a government to negotiate with, not just the Ministry of Planning, although the minister is very good. There is no prime minister, there is no five-year plan, there is no one-year plan, nothing. State structures are not existing, so that's a problem. Countries like Japan have had good success with smaller projects, so I shouldn't use that excuse for our problems in Iraq. But there needs to be the correct interlocutor. The system, the situation is unreliable. It's not the people, they are very reliable. All the ministers are very reliable. But they are new in their jobs and don't have the staff, the power, or the authority to give instructions. They don't have good communications. There is no banking. Q: How was the US-appointed Iraqi Governing Council's rejection of Turkish troops to help bolster security in the country viewed back home in Turkey? A: We felt relieved when it was rejected. We made a good-faith offer after receiving an invitation from the United States. We saw our troops would be welcome if they were not under the command of the Coalition forces. If it was a stabilising force, it would be welcome. But the Kurdish reaction was so strong, it was backed by others in the Governing Council. Q: There are some 12,000 Kurds from Turkey living in northern Iraq - what is their situation now and are they returning home? A: The Turkish Kurds are mainly people who moved to Iraq when the PKK [Kurdistan Worker's Party] and [Turkish] security forces conflict reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s. We realised the PKK's aim was to create a base where more militants were in their ranks. Once a refugee camp becomes more permanent, it is a way of life. So, the situation in the camp is that PKK elements in Iraq want the camp to stay as it is. But the security situation in Turkey is now safe. People can come back now. It won't be easy but we have to show them the way. We still must negotiate some details, however. Q: What assistance will you give these refugees? How will you integrate their return into Turkish society? A: There is an agreement between UNHCR [the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] Turkey and Iraq to close down this camp. But a lot of people don't want to go back. There are things the Turkish government will do and there are things UNHCR will do. The United States says it will also help, but now, as sovereignty comes to Iraq [scheduled for 30 June] there is a little bit of foot-dragging on the part of the United States on making guarantees for the safe and orderly implementation of this agreement. The problem is, in a few months they'll say they're out of this. The agreement didn't enter into force yet, but refugees would return to their villages. The Turkish government doesn't promise jobs or houses, but it would help. It will be the job of the governorates [in Turkey] to make sure this happens. Repatriation has to be orderly. It will take several months or a year. Some housing will be necessary, since houses may have been damaged before. If the refugees are going to rebuild, instead of mud houses, they should get more modern housing. Many in the camp married Iraqis. Some children don't know Turkish at all, and the families have not been home in more than a decade. So adaptation for them is quite a project. UNHCR requires help to bring the people back, and they need to be screened. If people are accused of terrorist activities, they have the right to find out if they are accused of any crimes. This process will be completed before they go back. With housing and other things, the World Bank can help, the European Union can help. Q: How are commercial relations between Turkey and Iraq, especially with regards to the oil pipeline leading to the Ceyhan terminal? A: The pipeline was sabotaged many times on the Iraq side. But as long as it is safe and operational on the Iraq side, crude oil will be pumped from the Iraq terminal. Oil production overall is not at 100 percent efficiency yet. In the short-term, [the southern city of] Basra will be the key, but in the north there are more oil fields in the Kirkuk area that have not been exploited. Some people say Iraq's reserves are still twice as much as the current known oil in Iraq, but it will take billions of dollars to explore. We also know there are natural gas fields in Mosul. Q: Are you involved with oil exploration in Iraq now? A: We can build other pipelines, so we see a huge potential for cooperation between Turkey and Iraq on this. But when we talk to the [US-appointed] Governing Council, they say they are temporary and cannot make a permanent decision because it's not their role to make such an important national decision. Technically, it's not possible to increase oil production overnight. The first thing Iraq needs is political stability. Oil pumping can come later. Q: Overall, what's your sense of Turkish relations with Iraq? A: Relationships between individuals are very good. The fact that the Turkish parliament declined to send troops was well received. We have much in common historically and culturally. But Kurdish nationalism was on the rise after the war. The fact that they had protection from [former President Saddam] Hussein gave them a lot of power. The idea now is to integrate them into a new regime, but they refuse to be integrated. They say they do not want to be an independent Kurdish state. They want to be part of Iraq, but they are like a detachable structure."
Focus on Palestinian refugees,"Take a 30 km drive out of the heart of the Syrian capital, Damascus, to a relatively poor area, down dusty roads and you arrive at the Khan Eshieh camp, accommodating some 17,000 Palestinian refugees. The camp has become a small town in its own right with many houses, six schools, a health clinic and community centre, as well as shops and other facilities to help the refugees live a better life. Some children play happily in the streets, and as the school bells ring the sound of excited students pouring into the playground can be heard all around. This is the second generation of Palestinians who have not been to their homeland but have only heard about it from their parents. The community at Khan Eshieh is part of some 417,350 Palestinians in Syria today. Three quarters of them live in Damascus with the rest being in the cities of Homs, Hama, Aleppo, Lattakia and Dara'a. There are 10 camps in total countrywide, with five of them around Damascus. LIFE IN SYRIA According to Lex Takkenberg, director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Syria, the Palestinians in Syria are accepted and helped by the government. ""Most Palestinians are integrated in Syria and some even hold positions within the government,"" he told IRIN in Damascus. At present UNRWA is working on upgrading camps in addition to its regular work provision of health care, education and social services. The largest refugee area in Syria is Yarmouk, a Damascus suburb, housing 137,000 refugees. ""The General Authority for Palestine Arab Refugees (GAPAR), a government body that liases with UNRWA, provides infrastructure and administrative services in the camps,"" Takkenberg explained. The main flow of Palestinian refugees to Syria took place between 1948 and 1949 when the State of Israel was being established. The second movement was in 1967 during the Israeli/Arab war when large numbers of Palestinians went to the Gulf States, Jordan and other areas of the Middle East, including Syria. ""Life is made miserable for them and it is a big problem for Palestinians, especially those with children in Gaza or the West Bank,"" he stressed, adding that emergency appeals were being made in Gaza and West Bank where Palestinians were ""literally starving"". Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict, UNRWA was established by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 302 (IV) on 8 December 1949 to carry out direct relief and works programmes for Palestine refugees. The agency began operations on 1 May 1950 and, in the absence of a solution to the Palestinian refugee problem, the General Assembly has repeatedly renewed UNRWA's mandate, most recently extending it until 30 June 2008. Since its establishment, the agency has delivered its services in times of relative calm in the Middle East, and in times of hostilities. It has fed, housed and clothed tens of thousands of fleeing refugees and at the same time educated and given health care to hundreds of thousands of young refugees. KHAN ESHIEH RESIDENTS The residents of Khan Eshieh came mainly from northern towns in Palestine. The land they now live on was allocated by the Syrian government. Shelters were built initially from mud and eventually turned into brick houses. The refugees have found work in farms and workshops. UNRWA provides education services in six schools. But refugee shelters are old and need repair. ""The curriculum is based on that of the Syrian Ministry of Education. As well as the usual subjects such as maths, religious studies and science, children also learn English and French and computer science,"" UNRWA Damascus Area Officer, Mohammed Johar, told IRIN at Khan Eshieh. Pressure is now mounting on teachers to offer additional subjects, but with the school already holding two shifts they say it is impossible. ""Teachers are already working long hours and we need more of them and more money to pay them for extra shifts,"" Johar said. Some 413 children are attending one of the schools at the camp, which only has 13 teachers. Teachers complain that the building is old with large cracks appearing in the soiled walls, many of which are neither plastered nor painted. Despite this, the children, around 40 per classroom, sit studiously, eager to answer questions. Dressed in a royal blue uniform with a headscarf neatly tucked around her face, 14-year-old Shaima told how her family came to Syria from Tiberias in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). ""I was born here, but my parents talk about Palestine,"" she said with a big grin on her face. Most of the second generation living in Syria have never been able to visit home. ""I know it is not perfect, but I like coming to school. It's fun and I have a lot of friends,"" said the girl sitting next to Shaima. ""My parents said life was hard for us back home,"" she added. Others expressed a desire to see their homeland. ""I would love to see my homeland, but there are so many terrible things happening there.. But one day I will, inshallah!"" Barea'a, 14, told IRIN. ""I feel so sad for the people there, they are suffering,"" she added. HEALTH AND HYGIENE NEEDS The camp has become a village with preventive health facilities and specialised clinics focusing on disease control, diabetes, dentistry and any other refugee health needs. ""This health centre is overcrowded and we need to recruit more staff,"" Dr Muna Haj Hussein, medical officer in charge of the agency's Khan Eshieh Health Centre, told IRIN. She outlined the main health problems in the camp which include hereditary sickle cell anaemia and blood diseases, as well as respiratory infections during the summer affecting mainly children. Waiting patiently, refugees spoke about what life was like for them in Syria. ""I suffer because I want to go home. I feel depressed. Life would be better if the fighting stopped back home and we could all return,"" refugee Hosam Awad told IRIN at the health centre. ""I am an engineer, but I am doing any job I can find whenever I can find it,"" he added. One of the main problems at the camp is the water supply. At present a project is under way to improve the water and sewage system. The 8 million euro project, funded by the EU, will ensure that residents have safe water on a daily basis, as well as a clean environment. At present they receive 14,000 cubic metres of water per day, but their needs are three times that. There is no piped water available in the camp, causing intestinal diseases. ""There is no treatment for sewage in the camp. It is being discharged into rivers and valleys and this causes major health concerns,"" Project Manager, Mohammed Suttari told IRIN at the project office. A recent survey by the World Health Organisation (WHO) showed that 10 percent of the population of Damascus suffered stomach problems. Additional services offered to the refugees include a community centre which doubles as a women's programme centre, where they can learn skills such as sewing, pattern-making and hairdressing, as well as a nursery for children. As well as the basic services provided by UNRWA to the refugees in Khan Eshieh, those who are in a more vulnerable position receive increased assistance. Some eight percent of the refugees are in extreme hardship and receive food and cash aid."
Uzbek refugees leave country,"More than 400 Uzbek asylum seekers have been airlifted to the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, and are set to leave for a third country shortly, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). ""The 426 Uzbek refugees who were in the Sasyk-Bulak camp in southern Kyrgyzstan are currently in Bishkek,"" Carlos Zaccagnini, head of the UNHCR mission in Kyrgyzstan, said from Bishkek on Thursday. “The [UN] High Commissioner for Refugees has given refugee status to 451 asylum seekers from Uzbekistan on Wednesday and they are now UNHCR mandated refugees,"" Zaccagnini explained, including 25 refugees still being held in detention by Kyrgyz authorities. The UNHCR mandated refugees are under the direct protection of the UN refugee agency and not of any particular member state. More than 500 Uzbeks crossed the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border early on 14 May, one day after Uzbek security forces violently suppressed protests in the eastern Uzbek city of Andijan. The Uzbek government said that the death toll was 187, but rights groups claimed that almost 1,000 unarmed civilians may have been shot in and around Andijan by Uzbek security forces. The refugees from the Sasyk-Bulak camp were airlifted from southern Kyrgyzstan to Bishkek on Wednesday and Thursday, while 29 Uzbek asylum seekers were still held in detention in the southern city of Osh, of whom 25 were declared refugees by UNHCR. ""We are still seeking the release of the 25 refugees in detention, so we hope this will occur in the course of afternoon and we are standing by. The remaining four have not been declared refugees for the moment, so we are not in a position to evacuate them today,"" the UNHCR official maintained. But while the evacuation of the refugees for third country resettlement was set for Thursday night, the UNHCR mission head declined to say where. ""We cannot disclose the country the refugees are heading to yet,"" he said. Some media reports suggested Canada may be their final destination, but UNHCR said it was currently discussing the next stage of the transfer from Bishkek with various countries, with plans yet to be finalised. Meanwhile, the Kyrgyz Akipress news agency reported on Thursday that the country's Security Council reportedly ruled to keep 14 refugees of those held in detention in the country. ""The Prosecutor General Azimbek Beknazarov got the Security Council meeting on Wednesday to endorse to retain 14 refugees out of the 29 in the Osh detention centre,"" the report claimed. A major Kyrgyz pro-democracy NGO, the Coalition For Democracy and Civil Society, urged the Kyrgyz authorities to follow its international commitments and release the 25 refugees. ""There cannot be any half measure. Kyrgyzstan should comply with all the UN requirements and allow [UNHCR] to evacuate all refugees, including those 25 from the Osh detention centre,"" Edil Baisalov, head of the group, said in a statement."
Focus on Turkish Kurdish refugees in north,"Tahsin Alatash shakes with his left hand. His right arm hangs limply by his side and it hurts him to move it. ""The doctor told me the bone was broken,"" he told IRIN in Gri Gowry, a village 10 km west of the northern Iraqi governorate of Dahuk. ""He told me I needed a plaster."" Asked why he never got one, he replied that he didn't know. He's too proud to say he doesn't have the money to pay the medical costs. Like the other inhabitants of this dusty settlement, Alatash is a refugee from Turkey. His village, Dumlica or Silip, was destroyed in October 1993, he said at the height of Ankara's counter-insurgency war against the then-separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. ""The PKK killed five soldiers near the village and we were blamed for it,"" he explained. Around 70 percent of the estimated 13,000 Turkish Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq live an hour southeast of the northern Kurdish governorate of Arbil in a camp, Mahmour, that Ankara has described in the past as no better than a base for the PKK. As many as 15,000 Kurdish Turks fled the clashes between Turkish troops and the PKK, a 15-year conflict that claimed an estimated 36,000 lives and left thousands of homes destroyed. Alatash is one of about 4,000 refugees scattered around refugee camps in the northwestern Iraqi governorate of Dahuk. With 120 families - approximately 600 people - Gri Gowry is one of the largest. There are 183 more refugee families in the mixed Christian-Muslim town of Mesirika, three km to the east. ""Neither Gri Gowry nor Mesirika is a refugee camp, strictly speaking,"" explained Kate O'Rourke, project manager for the Dahuk-based Swedish NGO Diakonia, due shortly to start working with the refugees. ""In both places, the refugees are living alongside either indigenous Kurds or local IDPs [internally displaced people]."" Given that they speak a Kurdish dialect almost identical to that spoken around Dahuk, the only thing singling the refugees out is their extreme poverty. Though their houses are built on land provided to them in 1997 by the Kurdistan Regional Government, Gri Gowry's Turkish Kurds have neither fields nor flocks. Technically forbidden to work, the men admit to trying to supplement their families' food rations from NGOs with money earned as temporary labourers in Dahuk. ""There is a clinic in Gri Gowry,"" said one woman holding a baby suffering from an eye infection, ""but it was built before we moved here and rarely has enough medicine for us too."" She added that she can't afford to take the taxi to Dahuk. ""In part because they're less political and less well-organised, these people are living in worse conditions than the refugees at Mahmour,"" said O'Rourke. ""They feel very neglected, particularly since UNHCR [the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] closed down operations last year."" The United Nations' decision to scale back operations in Iraq, following the August 2003 bombing of its headquarters in Baghdad has further implications for the refugees. While children born between 1993 and 2003 have received refugee status from UNHCR, parents have been unable to register babies born since last year, in effect relegating them to the status of illegal aliens. The refugees themselves have more immediate concerns. ""We built our houses with UNHCR materials in 1997,"" said Hussein Abdulrahman, 45. ""Since then, two of my sons have got married, but we're all still living under the same roof."" Many of the three- or four-room houses contain up to 10 people. But with discussions continuing between Turkey, Iraq, US officials and the UNHCR on a plan for the organised voluntary return of these refugees, building new houses is a controversial issue. ""It unfortunately seems as though there are directives saying that no steps that might make their situation permanent should be taken,"" explained Christian Lagerlof, Diakonia's regional manager told IRIN in Dahuk. UNHCR is, however, providing assistance, care and maintenance to some 1,000 people in Mahmour as well as supporting four schools there. In addition, the agency is also providing reintegration assistance in the form of housing for 400 IDP families and community development activities in 26 villages in Arbil and Qushtapa district, as well as support for IDPs and refugees who have returned in Dohuk Governorate and the districts of Dohun and Shekhan. Based in Dahuk since 1991, Diakonia is due to take over the UNHCR's old job of supervising food distribution to local refugee camps within the next six to eight weeks. ""We'll also be using the UNHCR budget to provide some form of vocational training,"" Lagerlof said. ""Refugees doing nothing but waiting passively are more difficult to reintegrate into society if and when they return."" Lagerlof had originally hoped UNHCR in Amman would give money to enable refugees to benefit from the same psycho-social and vocational training centres he oversees in Dahuk. Though the US $200,000 he has been offered is enough only for mobile teams, he is optimistic that Diakonia's usual sponsor, the Swedish International Development Agency, will also contribute. ""These people look set for a long stay, because I don't think the Kurdish authorities will agree to them being forced out against their will,"" he said. Faced with the prospect of return, the refugees themselves are caught in two minds. The clock in Hussein Abdulrahman's house is still set on Turkish time, but his children study Arabic and Kurdish at the local school. ""If I could be sure we would be allowed to live peacefully in our old village, I would go tomorrow,"" he said. ""I miss my family over there. All we are doing here is surviving, living on bread and memories."" Others are more sceptical. They claim that the 15 Gri Gowry families who have already returned to Turkey had their food and belongings taken away at the border. Their villages in ruins, they are living with relatives or in rented accommodation. ""What is there for us to do over there?"" asked Taha Chelik. ""No houses, no work. It's a desert."" Suleiman Ismail agreed. ""We have no problems at all with the local Kurds,"" he said. ""If they gave me a house and a bit of land I could call my own, I'd accept it with alacrity."""
UN refugee agency responds to influx of Congolese refugees,"The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees is reinforcing its operations in Burundi and working with local authorities to establish new camps for some 31,000 Congolese refugees who arrived in the country over the last two weeks, UNHCR said on Tuesday. The majority of new arrivals have been from eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). They began arriving on 9 June following increased fighting between dissident soldiers, led by Col. Jules Mutebutsi and Gen Laurent Nkunda, and loyal Congolese government forces, UNHCR reported. ""No major new refugee arrivals from the DRC have been reported since last week, but the reported presence of increasing numbers of troops along the DRC, Rwanda and Burundi borders is undoubtedly affecting movements,"" Jennifer Pagonis, a UNHCR spokeswoman, said on Tuesday at a news briefing in Geneva. There have been small repatriations since the fighting began on 26 May. Fighting has now ended, with the retreat of dissident troops to neighbouring Rwanda. UNHCR reported on Sunday that it had facilitated the return of 137 refugees to DRC. However, to cope with the influx into Burundi, the UNHCR has sent a senior emergency officer to the country. The UNHCR spokesman in Burundi, Bernard Ntwari, said eight emergency officers would be sent to Burundi this week. UNHCR said the Burundian government had agreed to provide land for new camps in the province of Cankuzo, some 200 km east of the Congolese border. Ntwari said on Saturday that Medecins Sans Frontieres, the Ministry of Health, and other NGO partners had begun a joint measles vaccination effort for recently arrived refugee children in Burundi. Two camp residents died of cholera last week, although Ntwari said there was no way to determine if they had contracted the disease before or after they entered the camp. Nevertheless, UNHCR has taken measures to prevent a possible outbreak. ""These measure include providing efficient sanitation, as well as education programmes to sensitise refugees to the dangers of cholera,"" he added."
Palestinian refugees still waiting to be moved,"They may be the world's longest-suffering refugees, but the Palestinian families sitting in the sweltering heat of the dusty football field at Haifa Sports Club in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Sunday had no idea that it was World Refugee Day. ""I hope this occasion of World Refugee Day can serve as a bridge for us to help us go home,"" Huda Naif Sahaa, 43, told IRIN. ""I've never heard of this World Refugee Day, but I want to know more about it if it helps us."" Some 35 families are still living in tents at the sports club. Already, 140 families have been relocated, according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The refugee agency is assisting 450 Palestinian families in Baghdad by subsidising rents, providing medical care and other relief items. In 2003, UNHCR registered some 23,000 Palestinians in Baghdad but the total number in the Iraqi capital is estimated to be around 30,000. But those remaining at the club say conditions are unbearable in the stifling summer heat. ""It's like hell to live here,"" Sameer Mohammed, 24, told IRIN as he stroked his little boy Ahmed's head. ""My wife has got typhoid, we think from the water, so she's in the hospital now."" Under former President Saddam Hussein, Palestinian refugees in Iraq received special housing privileges, paying cheap rent that landlords raised when the regime fell in April 2003. That forced many of the families to leave their previous homes. The former government only provided enough housing for about 12 percent of the estimated 35,000 Palestinians in Iraq anyway, according to statistics supplied by Anwar Sheikh, a refugee who acts as an administrator at Haifa camp. The camp was set up almost a year ago in a sports complex previously used by the refugees when they lived in nearby apartment buildings before the rising rents forced them out. ""We are not even registered in Iraq, but we would like to go home,"" Sheikh told IRIN. ""Israel should allow refugees to come home."" Ask anyone living in the camp and they tell you the same thing. Munder Amed Abdul Saif, also living at the sports club, told IRIN he still considered himself a refugee, even though he had spent his whole life in Iraq. ""I must move to my family's birthplace,"" Saif said, smiling. ""It is not acceptable to live here. We must be allowed to return."" UNHCR started a registration programme for refugees to get a better sense of their profile to better plan assistance, but it has been a slow process due to a scaling down of operations following security concerns, Sheikh said. Under Saddam Hussein, the refugees received identity documents but not passports, he added. ""To date, more than 23,000 people have been registered but the documentation, which is done through UNHCR headquarters in Geneva, was not finished before security deteriorated,"" spokeswoman for UNHCR's Iraq operations, Astrid Van Genderen Stort, told IRIN from the Jordanian capital, Amman. ""If we have to stay outside our native country for another 50 years, we demand that all forces in the world, including the United Nations, recognise our humanitarian rights,"" Sheikh said. ""We suffer a lot. We're just asking for the world to understand us."" Refugees say government authorities are dealing with their case at a slow pace. ""Our file is being moved to the Ministry of Migration and Displacement, so we met the minister to ask how he could help us,"" Sheikh said. ""He said he would take care of us, but nothing has happened."" Officials at the ministry said they are waiting for money to be dispatched to help subsidise rents. Elsewhere in the region, 170 Palestinians who fled Iraq last year have now left a no man's land site and the adjacent al-Ruweished refugee camp on the Jordanian border and returned to Baghdad. The refugees said they had given up hope of finding a new home in the Middle East and preferred to return to Baghdad. UNHCR is providing all the returnees with transport assistance and various relief items. Meanwhile, although refugee returns are continuing to Iraq, the UN refugee agency is not encouraging them, but instead facilitating convoys, in cooperation with the Iraqi authorities, for those who wish to go home. In June more than 350 Iraqi refugees returned in two separate convoys from Khuzestan and Fars provinces in Iran to Basra Governorate in southern Iraq, bringing the total number of returnees to some 11,500 with most coming from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. UNHCR is planning to provide further support for the reintegration of returning refugees and displaced Iraqis in the three northern governorates of Arbil, Ninewa and Dahuk, and for Turkish refugees at Mahmour camp, near Arbil, and Syrian refugees settled in Baghdad, a UNHCR statement said."
Refugees detained for attempting protest,"The commemoration of World Refugee Day in Namibia on Monday was marred by the detention of three asylum seekers who were allegedly attempting to ""disrupt"" the event. Police public relations officer Hophni Hamufungu told IRIN that the refugees ""had gone against orders"" and would be held in custody until the day's proceedings were over. ""It was made clear to the refugees that they would not be allowed to stage a demonstration on World Refugee Day,"" said Hamufungu. ""They chose to ignore this and we had no option but to detain those who we felt were intent on provoking the authorities."" The Association of Refugee Rights (ADR), which claims to represent 13,000 asylum seekers at the Osire refugee camp about 300 km north of the capital, Windhoek, planned to demonstrate during the celebrations against alleged ill treatment by the local authorities. ""We applied to the regional police headquarters for permission to go ahead with the demonstration, but did not receive any confirmation until this morning (Monday). We thought that World Refugee Day would be an ideal opportunity to voice our frustrations, but the authorities do not want the international community to know just how badly we are being mistreated,"" ADR chairman MacGoddins Lushimba complained. He said several refugees had been injured in scuffles with the police, but the police have denied the claim. Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said it would contact the police to determine if the refugees would be formally charged. ""As soon as we learnt that the police had turned down their request, we advised the refugees not to go ahead with the protest. But contrary to our advice, a handful of refugees decided to stage the protest anyway. While the UNHCR will continue to follow up on the concerns of the refugees, we have to act within the confines of the country's laws,"" UNHCR Country Representative Hesdy Radhling said. Last year the refugee group also staged a protest during the celebrations over what it said were gross human rights violations committed by the Namibian authorities against the refugee population. ""The Namibian government does not adhere to its own laws, which explicitly protect refugees. We are not provided with the most basic things, such as paraffin for cooking. We find that it is nearly impossible to leave the camp, and our children's prospects are very limited even if they are educated,"" Lushimba told IRIN. Earlier this month four asylum seekers at Osire were detained by police for inciting other refugees into boycotting paraffin, the only source of energy they receive. The refugees were demanding four litres of paraffin per person, in addition to the paraffin they had allegedly not received for the past two months."
Iraqi refugee repatriation continues,"Some 4,836 Iraqi refugees living in Iran have recently returned home under the repatriation programme run by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). ""UNHCR is not promoting repatriation due to the bad security situation inside Iraq, but only facilitating return to those Iraqis that specifically request,"" spokeswoman for UNHCR's Iraq operations, Astrid van Genderen Stort, told IRIN from the Jordanian capital, Amman on Wednesday. Although officials say a normal repatriation programme is not being operated due to the security situation inside Iraq, Iraqis are being assisted as they are desperate to return and often try and cross a dangerous heavily mined border themselves in order to go home, putting their lives at risk. UNHCR is presently arranging three convoys a week of 300-500 refugees returning home. It is estimated that some 100,000 Iraqi refugees are still in Iran. Of this figure some 9,600 are estimated to be in camps in Fars in the northwest and in Khuzestan and Bushehr in southwestern Iran. ""Not all of these refugees are planning to return immediately due to the situation in their own country,"" she added. Most of the remaining 100,000 refugees in Iran had been living there since the Iran-Iraq war, primarily in the Ashrafi camp, located 150 km north of Ahvaz, the capital of Khuzestan. However, the camp was closed in February when the last convoy of Iraqis were repatriated to their homeland. Of those who have returned, UNHCR has assisted about 5,000, with others making spontaneous journeys back to Iraq. Under the refugee agency's programme, which started in November, beneficiaries are given US $20 and free transportation to the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Most of the returnees stay in Basra and Diqar also in the south or move on to Maysan in the east, entering through the Shalamshea border crossing, the UNHCR spokeswoman said."
Refugees in protest over their welfare,"Some 20 Congolese and Burundian refugees protested on Wednesday outside the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, against a reduction in the agency's food aid to mainly urban refugees. ""We are bitter. We sleep on streets and go for days without food and yet we are supposed to be provided with these needs,"" said one refugee, identified only as Kasongo, from North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The refugees also complained about delays in the provision of identity documents from the UNHCR and the government. They denounced the delays in the procedures for transfers to refugee camps or for resettlement in third countries. However, in a statement, the UNHCR said the aid offered to the Congolese and Burundian refugees was in line with the policies of the Rwandan government, which emphasises that assistance be made available to refugees in camps outside Kigali. UNHCR also said in the case of refugees who are not permitted to live in camps due to nationality or serious security concerns, a limited amount of food aid was available in Kigali, especially for vulnerable families. ""Other asylum seekers and refugees are free to choose to reside in Kigali, but are expected to seek independent means to meet their needs,"" the UNHCR said. The protesting refugees, mainly women, children and the elderly, claimed that the UNHCR and the Rwandan government were denying them their rights to basic needs such as shelter and food. ""Recent reductions of the number of families receiving food assistance in Kigali reflect a tighter adherence to this long-term policy, which has been repeatedly communicated to the urban refugee population,"" the UNHCR said. The agency added that resources previously used for food aid had been redirected towards other self-reliance projects and medical services for refugees in Kigali and in camps. However, it maintained that health care and school fees for primary and secondary school education were provided by the UNHCR for all asylum seekers and refugees in Kigali. ""Resettlement to third countries for refugees is available on a case-by-case basis,"" it said. ""The criteria for resettlement are determined by the resettlement countries, which also make the final decision on acceptance."""
Twelve refugee camps to close,"Pakistan is set to close more than a dozen Afghan refugee camps within four weeks, citing concerns over security. The camps have a total population of over 30,000 and are located in the North Waziristan agency of the western tribal belt, officials told IRIN. ""In total, about 14 camps would be closed. However, the [Afghan] population living outside the camps in urban or rural settlements would be allowed to stay on in the area,"" Jehangir Khan, head of the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CAR), said in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. According to the recent census of Afghans living in Pakistan, some 58,000 Afghan refugees are living in North Waziristan agency, over 30,000 of them in camps. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides health and education services to the camps, through implementing partners. In a similar move in June last year, about 30,000 Afghan refugees in the adjoining South Waziristan agency were asked to leave the area, which was the scene of a full-scale offensive by Pakistani security forces as they attempted to weed out Islamic militants from positions near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. UNHCR has started preparing information leaflets to let Afghans know that they may choose either to be repatriated or to be relocated to other areas. ""The material would be handed over to the CAR officials towards the end of this week, to distribute it amongst the Afghans living in camps since we can't move into the area,"" Jack Redden, a UNHCR spokesman, said. In 2004, the UNHCR closed down about 12 'new' camps established near the Pakistan-Afghan border to shelter those fleeing the conflict of late 2001 in Afghanistan. Around 82,000 out of a total of 190,000 Afghans availed themselves of the refugee agency's special package for repatriation from ""new"" camps, while other opted for relocation to other sites. The UNHCR has started consultations with the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan over long-term solutions for the millions of Afghans who may wish to stay on after the current tripartite agreement that runs out in March 2006. ""It also involves the rehabilitation of the refugee-affected areas. Beside, we are looking at providing assistance to those areas where Afghans are living at present, so that could be helpful for both Pakistani as well as Afghan communities,"" Redden said. Meanwhile, the Pakistan government is in consultation with different stakeholders with a view to the closure of more camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) and Balochistan province, Khan said. A total of about 2.3 million Afghan refugees have returned from Pakistan since the voluntary repatriation assistance programme of the UNHCR started in 2002. Nearly 70,000 have gone back so far this year. The refugee agency estimates some 400,000 Afghans will return by the end of the year out of over three million living in Pakistan."
Tripartite refugee commission meets,"A three-way commission, mandated to oversee the repatriation of Afghan refugees to their homeland, held its fourth meeting in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, on Monday. A spokesman for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) called the meeting ""successful"". The Tripartite Commission was created in March 2003, after an agreement was signed between the government of Pakistan, the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan and UNHCR, which governs the repatriation process for Afghan refugees opting to return home to Afghanistan. ""It moved the discussion along and we resolved some of the minor questions. But it also moved us along towards thinking about where we're heading over the next couple of years and beyond,"" Jack Redden, a UNHCR spokesman, told IRIN in Islamabad. The meeting came three weeks after the resumption of the repatriation process, which was suspended in November following the murder of a UNHCR worker in southern Afghanistan. The agreement, governing the repatriation process, runs through 2005. ""Everybody is quite conscious that this existing agreement only runs until March 2006, and after that, we'll have to think about how we're going to handle any residual Afghan populations here in Pakistan,"" Redden said. Not all Afghans in Pakistan are refugees so the commission would have to think in terms of how to approach that angle, he explained. ""Some will require the continued protection of UNHCR as refugees but, perhaps, others will fall under some sort of a migration agreement between the countries,"" Redden maintained. Chaired by the government of Pakistan, the meeting took note of the fact that more than 20,000 refugees have returned to Afghanistan since the repatriation process restarted in early March 2004. The three parties agreed that more intensive efforts will be made to inform refugee communities of improved conditions in areas of likely return, a UNHCR press statement said. ""These steps will include the identification of specific areas within Afghanistan where the situation is more conducive to return, improved dissemination of information, including by radio, and more contacts between communities of origin and refugee communities,"" the statement added. The commission also said that there needed to be more focused attention on potential obstacles to refugee return, such as access to land. ""That's an ongoing thing because the question of land is one of the obstacles that comes up continually with refugees: that they don't have land and therefore, they can't move back,"" Redden explained, adding that a resolution of land allocation questions by the Afghan government would help those trying to return. The members agreed on the importance of ensuring that refugees are registered and able to vote in the Afghan elections announced for September 2004, UNHCR said. ""The government of Pakistan reiterated its willingness to facilitate the process on its territory and awaits a formal announcement from the government of Afghanistan that it wishes to conduct polling in Pakistan and Iran,"" it added. ""Since it is holding an election for another country in Pakistan, Pakistan has to be party to the agreement under which this is going to be done,"" Redden stressed. ""But Pakistan is very supportive of the Afghans voting in the elections in Afghanistan. The concern is purely on the short time available to get moving on this,"" he maintained. The commission also agreed that a report by the Working Group on Census and Registration of Afghans in Pakistan should examine the possibility of incorporating the out-of-country voter registration into the planned Afghan census and registration. A United Nations Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA)representative in Islamabad will be invited to join the group, which will develop a plan of action, to be presented to all stakeholders by the third week of April."
Iranian refugees moving to north,"Swedish NGO Qandil is working in collaboration with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to build accommodation for 250 Iranian Kurdish refugee families who recently went to the northern Sulaymaniyah governorate, saying they had left deteriorating conditions in Al-Tash camp in the western Iraqi province of Al-Anbar. Families have been moving north for months now, but the trickle turned into a flood in April and May as violence in the Sunni triangle peaked with pitched battles between US forces and the Iraqi resistance in the city of Fallujah, near Al-Tash. Aid agencies say they have been able to provide residents of Al-Tash with medicine and the government is providing food. ""Life was bad before the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime,"" Aziz Mohamed Mohamedi, a Kurd from Iran's western Kermanshah province, told IRIN in his sweltering, fly-filled tent just off the main Sulaymaniyah to Kalar road at Pungala. ""With the fighting that followed the war, though, humanitarian aid almost totally dried up - we had almost no electricity, limited food rations, and no medicine at all."" UNHCR has been providing aid in Al-Tash, through the Italian NGO Intersos, including non-food items, water and sanitation and income generation projects. The refugee agency is not however, encouraging people to move from the camp due to security reasons as the road between the camp and the north is deemed unsafe, it says. In addition to this, UNHCR has raised concerns regarding facilities for people returning to the north, including lack of shelter. Refugees at Pungala, a barren promontory housing 17 families overlooking the river Sirwan, said their relations with locals in Al-Tash and the nearby town of Ramadi had been tense since they were obliged to settle there by the Baathist regime in 1982 as part of Saddam Hussein's ""Arabisation programme"". But tensions grew tremendously with the start of the Coalition war. ""There are many Saddam loyalists in Ramadi, people who hate Iraq's Kurds for fighting alongside the Americans,"" explained Mohamed Sala Heydar who, like other Al-Tash residents, was forced to leave Iran by the invading Iraqi army in 1980. ""Whenever we left the camp to work, they insulted us, called us infidel friends of Israel and beat us up. Life became intolerable,"" Heydar said. US forces entered the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk with Kurdish fighters last year during the war that ousted Saddam Hussein. Other refugees claim they stopped going outside Al-Tash altogether after a mullah in Fallujah responded to rumours that elite Iraqi Kurdish militias were fighting alongside US troops outside the city with a fatwa (religious order) permitting the murder of any Kurd. Scattered in tent villages and rented accommodation in and around Khaniqin, Kalar, Darbendikhan and Arbat, the Iranian Kurds refugees receive aid both from Qandil and from the local departments of Sulaymaniyah governorate's Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. Despite that, though, the situation at Pungala and in other tent villages is fairly dire. Aziz Mohamedi points to the corner of the tent, where his three-year-old son, Falah, is lying asleep, his face covered by flies. ""This morning I took him to the clinic to get him treated for diarrhoea, probably caused by the water we drink here,"" he told IRIN. ""They told me that they had no drugs."" ""What these people need above all are houses, and a settled place to live,"" Qandil's Sulaymaniyah manager Nawzad Bilal told IRIN. ""We now have a piece of land for them, part of the collective town of Barika, near Arbat, and we're pushing hard for construction work to start as soon as possible."" Tenders for the construction contract opened this week in Arbil, he added, and work should begin within 10 days. According to Qandil's standards, the work, which is to include a water project and renovation of the existing electricity grid, must be completed within 100 days. Like other humanitarian workers involved with the former residents of Al-Tash, though, Nawzad Bilal fears the project could be insufficient. ""When we completed our survey [a month ago], we counted 250 families,"" he explained. ""Every week, three, four or five new families arrive."" And statistics gathered by Intersos after the fall of Saddam suggest there are around 700 families left in Al-Tash. ""In all likelihood, they will soon be following the rest of the camp up to the north."" That seems to be the opinion among the tent-dwellers of Pungala. Refugee Hassan Abdullah Mohamed said he has kept in close contact with those of his relatives still in Ramadi. ""The only thing that's stopping them coming up here,"" he said, ""is lack of money."""
New database to be key refugee tool,"A newly established computer database, one of the first in the region and managed by the Tajik State Migration Service, will prove instrumental in assisting thousands of refugees in mountainous Tajikistan, the vast majority of whom are Afghans. ""The database is not an end in itself, but rather one stage in an ongoing process of finding more durable solutions for the refugees and persons of concern living in this country,"" Nicholas Coussidis, country representative for the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told IRIN in the Tajik capital, Dushanbe, adding that profiling of those beneficiaries was the next stage of that process. ""We need to know who we are trying to help and such profiles allow us to properly protect, assist and provide solutions."" Data regarding the individual's names, number of family members, gender, places of origin, professional and educational background, along with legal status, were now being entered, providing UNHCR, along with the Tajik authorities, a more effective means of providing assistance. ""We are trying to put all that in the system, enabling us to find more meaningful solutions for the beneficiaries - whether it is repatriation, resettlement or local integration,"" Coussidis explained, noting: ""Unless we have a good profile, we cannot make effective decisions."" In a joint undertaking by the government and UNHCR and completed in mid March, approximately 2,600 refugees and persons of concern were re-registered and re-validated in the database. Previously, such files were handled completely by hand. One element of the re-registration effort was ensuring that women were registered in their own right - as individuals - and not merely under heads of families, the UNHCR country head said. ""It's her right. Not just his."" But while the physical process of registering all refugees already in the country in the database was complete, the process was far from over. ""The database is a living thing,"" Coussidis stressed, noting the importance of keeping it up to date. ""This is an ongoing activity,"" UNHCR protection officer Katja Storch concurred. ""Whenever someone comes or goes, that information must be entered,"" she told IRIN. UNHCR assists the Tajik State Migration Service, which on behalf of the Tajik government is responsible for the continuous updating of the system. Describing the current climate towards refugees and asylum seekers as positive, Coussidis noted they were currently working in collaboration with the government on current refugee legislation in the former Soviet republic. ""The increasing tolerance by the authorities towards refugees and asylum seekers is moving in a positive way,"" he observed. According to UNHCR, since the start of the voluntary repatriation effort in spring 2002 in neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, the two largest host countries to Afghan refugees, thousands of Afghans living in Tajikistan had also returned. In April 2002 the UN refugee agency assisted over 9,000 Afghans living along the banks of Pyandz river on the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan back to their homeland, with some 3,000 returning spontaneously or unassisted. Since then UNHCR has also facilitated the voluntary return of over 1,000 Afghans back to their country - mainly from Dushanbe and the northern city of Khujand - with another 1,000 returning spontaneously or being resettled elsewhere. ""It may not sound like big numbers compared to Pakistan and Iran - but given we initially started with 4,500 - it's significant,"" Coussidis stated."
No provision for Afghan refugees to vote,"Saeed Agha is a middle-aged Afghan mechanic living in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, who listens avidly to radio news broadcasts about the forthcoming parliamentary elections in his homeland. The programmes are transmitted in Dari, Pashto and Urdu to the millions of Afghans residing in neighbouring Pakistan but it's unlikely Agha or many of the others will get a chance to participate in the historic poll. ""I am sitting in Islamabad. How can I vote for someone in Baghlan [an Afghan province]?"" he asked. Many other Afghan refugees living in Pakistan are frustrated that they won’t be able to vote either. ""I do not have much money to cover my travel expenses to go to Afghanistan,"" said Mahmood, a shopkeeper living in an informal Afghan settlement on the outskirts of the capital. Some 1.35 million Afghans in Pakistan, aged 18 years and over, are eligible to vote out of a total of over three million, according to a recent census conducted in March 2005 by the Pakistani authorities in conjunction with the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The electoral process was very different for the Afghan presidential election in October 2004. Then the International Organization for Migration (IOM) arranged 'Out-of-Country Registration and Voting' (OCRV) for Afghans in both Iran and Pakistan on behalf of the Afghan Joint Election Management Body (JEMB) and the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). According to IOM, just under 600,000 Afghans voted in Pakistan in the Afghan presidential election, representing 80 percent of the 738,000 who had registered to vote. In Iran, where there was no pre-registration process, 260,000 refugees participated in the polls, amounting to about half of the eligible voters in the country, according to Peter Erben, director of IOM's OCRV programme, speaking in Islamabad last year when he gave details of the final ballot. The Pakistani authorities were in favour of Afghans in Pakistan voting in this election too but they said Kabul had not endorsed the idea. ""We proposed this time as well to make voting arrangements for the Afghans living in Pakistan. However, looking at the logistical challenges, the Afghan government didn't favour it,"" said Dr Imran Zeb, director of the Chief Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CCAR), the state body dealing with Afghan refugees in Pakistan. Sheikha Ali, head of IOM in Pakistan, confirmed that her organisation had not received any request from Kabul to arrange voting for Afghans in Pakistan. ""Last year, the out-of-country Afghan voting for the presidential election had been arranged at the request of the Afghan government. But, this year for parliamentary elections, the Afghan government has not asked us to arrange anything,"" she said. The JEMB in Kabul said there were no arrangements for Afghans outside the country to vote because the forthcoming poll was a vote for regional representatives to sit in parliament. ""Because this year’s election is constituency-based, refugees outside the country would have to go to their provinces if they want to vote. To have outside country voting, you have to have special seats for refugees in parliament but the Afghan government has not chosen to do this,"" Bronwyn Curran, spokeswoman for the JEMB, said in Kabul. Though Afghans living in Islamabad still want to vote and will miss out on the celebratory election environment, they have little faith that the election results will deliver any positive changes to war-ravaged Afghanistan, or that the process will bring any real improvements to the lives of ordinary people. ""Last year, we voted for Karzai [Afghan President] but what did he do for us? What can he do for us refugees who have been living in exile for the last 25 years and still with no hope of going back,"" an Afghan customer outside Agha's small shop said. More important to most refugees than elections, is the establishment of stability, peace and the beginning of economic development in Afghanistan. ""No Afghan would want to stay outside [Afghanistan], should the country show any sign of recovery,"" another man quickly added."
Preparation for Afghan refugee census,"The Pakistani government has planned a countrywide census of the Afghans living in the country, with the support of the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The purpose is to ascertain the exact number of Afghans living in Pakistan since 1979. ""We have almost done the preparatory work like mapping of Afghan hosting areas, and next month - December - is tentatively for the census,"" Ghulam Dastageer, head of Pakistan's Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CAR), told IRIN in the capital, Islamabad, on Wednesday. The country has been hosting over one million Afghan refugees - still the largest refugee population in the world - for more than two decades. UNHCR has so far assisted 2.28 million Afghans to return home, with 375,000 refugees this year. The population and census organisation of the country is preparing to conduct the census and registration of Afghans along with the mapping of areas of Afghan settlements. ""The exercise involves different phases - preparatory work has almost been done, and next step is counting, filling up forms, questionnaires and everything else,"" Dastageer said, adding: ""There has been some delays but now we are on it [the census], and we intend to do it next month."" ""The census will cover all Afghans here since 1979. It would be mandatory for Afghans and would count the number and composition of the population as well,"" Jack Redden, a UNHCR spokesman in Islamabad, told IRIN. The UN refugee agency is discussing the details of the survey procedure with the government, the spokesman said. UNHCR is operating a voluntary repatriation assistance programme for Afghan refugees living in Iran and Pakistan that runs till March 2006."
Syrian refugees receiving threats,"Syrian refugees in Iraq are facing tough times following the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. Mahmoud Abdalla has lived in Iraq since 1968 after being forced to flee Syria in fear of persecution, but now he says he feels like he is being persecuted in Iraq, due to resentment from local people. ""We face a lot of threats from different political parties. I was imprisoned last month for three weeks because of false reports being made against me as a Saddam loyalist,"" Abdalla told IRIN in Baghdad. He explained that Iraqis viewed the Syrians as supporters of the former regime because they received support from the deposed leader as did Palestinian refugees. Under Saddam, Syrian exiles were provided with ID cards, flats and a small monthly allowance. They were able to work and earn small amounts of cash, but now many are frightened and are living in misery. He added that many of his Syrian neighbours chose to leave Iraq after the war and head to Syria. ""They are now detained by the Syrian authorities,"" he claimed. The privileges that the refugees enjoyed created resentment among many Iraqis. The Syrians are now barricading themselves indoors by installing iron doors at the entrance of their homes and some have even been evicted. ""After the war, we had armed criminals stealing our houses. My neighbour who escaped after the fall of the regime and returned had to pay US $1,000 to get his flat back,"" Mahmoud explained. The Syrians' plight has been recognised by some aid agencies. Abdalla Quja, a lawyer, and a representative of Syrian refugees in Iraq, said that the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had started to register Syrians by giving them ID cards and some 650 refugees had come forward to be enrolled. The registration process also allowed staff to gain more information about the exiled Syrians who are said to be older than the usual refugee, with minors accounting for less than one-third of the group. Also, they are unusually well educated, with more than half of the adults holding advanced university degrees, according to the refugee agency. But this, it seems, is not enough for the Syrians to escape bad feelings from local people. ""Now we don't have protection as with the former government, so I was helping the UNHCR to get Syrians to register to have some rights, but after the attack on the UN building in Baghdad, the registration stopped and it's taking longer time to get help from the UNHCR via e-mails that I send,"" he explained. Quja, who is the president of the Committee for Syrian Human Rights, said he had his office broken into by US soldiers, and claimed he was receiving threats from the main opposition party during the former regime. ""We used to have better salaries in the 1980s from the government here, but during the 1990s it was very little because of the sanctions. I live now on assistance from my daughter who lives in Canada, but many Syrians here don't have a source of income anymore as we haven't received our monthly allowances since last March,"" Quja said. In an effort to sustain humanitarian work in the country at a time when many aid agencies have downscaled due to security threats, the UK-based Islamic Relief NGO has been working with UNHCR to help Syrian refugees. Many had lost their homes when rent subsidies ended. Those who remain in their accommodation have had to cope with increased rents while the value of the Iraqi dinar has fallen. A project to help 600 Syrian refugees living in Baghdad, by subsidising rents, covering the cost of medical treatment, and paying for student's transport and equipment costs, was established by the NGO with assistance from the UN. The beneficiaries of this joint venture are refugees who registered with the refugee agency in Baghdad in mid-June 2003. Mohammed Mekkey, the Iraqi mission commissioner at the Islamic Relief Foundation, said the programme, covering 59 Syrian families, was run in November and December last year. ""We've chosen some of the most vulnerable Syrian families to help, not those who live in subsidised rents. There are a lot of other Syrians who never had allowances from the government before, there are a lot of Syrians who came as refugees as they were persecuted in Syria and they were Muslim Brothers, not Baa'thists,"" Mekkey said. There is no accurate figure on how many Syrians are living in Iraq today Mekkey explained, adding that there were others in parts of the country, especially the north who had not been registered. ""Only 650 people (from 150 families) from Baghdad and 35 persons from Anbar province were registered,"" he said. UNHCR is in the process of finding a long-term solution in the form of repatriation to Syria or resettlement in another country for the refugees. Mekkey said the Programme Manager of Islamic Relief was now in Amman discussing the situation with aid agencies. ""From what we had discussed so far with UNHCR, resettlement sounds very difficult and it will take a long time before we could help them go back to Syria with protection because if they go there now they wont have any rights and could be summoned by the authorities,"" Mekkey said."
No progress on Andijan refugee four,"The plight of four men held in Kyrgyzstan facing possible extradition to Uzbekistan, despite being granted refugee status by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in October, continued to raise concern on Monday. ""The threat of their extradition is there. It's possible and we cannot exclude it,"" Anna Mee, a UNHCR national protection officer and acting officer-in-charge, said from the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. The four men, as well as a fifth described as an asylum seeker, are currently being held at a detention centre in the southern Kyrgyz city of Osh, in defiance of an extradition request by Uzbekistan for their alleged involvement in last spring's bloody demonstration in the southeastern Uzbek city of Andijan. Up to 1,000 people may have been killed when Uzbek security forces attempted to quell anti-government demonstrations in the city. Tashkent, which places the death toll at 187, has adamantly refused all calls for an international inquiry into the 13 May uprising. In the ensuing chaos after the event, hundreds of Uzbeks fled to neighbouring Kyrgyzstan for their safety. Originally classified as asylum seekers, almost 440 of those who registered were granted refugee status by UNHCR and later airlifted to Romania for third-country resettlement in late July, while another 15 remained in custody, pending an extradition request by Tashkent. Eleven of them were later granted UNHCR-mandated refugee status and subsequently flown to London on 16 September. More than six months on, however, the fate of the four men remains unresolved, with UNHCR increasingly concerned over their future. If the Kyrgyz court upholds a legal decision in support of the Kyrgyz Department of Migration Services (DMS) who initially denied the men refugee status, the situation could worsen. ""I really don't know what will happen,"" Mee said, citing a recent decision by the Kyrgyz authorities to extradite a member of the Kazakh opposition back to his country. ""It's really going to be a difficult fight,"" she said. But Mee is not alone in her concern. On Friday Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote in an open letter to Kyrygz President Kurmanbek Bakiev not to return the five men where they faced a real risk of torture. ""We urge President Bakiev to uphold Kyrgyzstan's international legal obligations and protect people who sought refuge there,"" Holly Cartner, executive director of HRW's Europe and Central Asia division, said. According to the watchdog group, Uzbek authorities used excessive and indiscriminate force against mostly unarmed protestors in Andijan and Tashkent's repeated call for the men's extradition was part of a massive campaign of repression that Uzbek authorities launched after the killings in an effort to silence and coerce testimony that would support the official version of events. Dozens of individuals accused of participation in the Andijan protest have already been tortured into confessing, HRW says, and the authorities have used coerced statements to obtain convictions in closed proceedings that blatantly violated national and international law. ""Torture is rampant in Uzbekistan and fair-trial standards are routinely ignored,"" Cartner said. ""Returning refugees to such a country is both illegal and unconscionable."" The return would violate the mandatory bar on the return of refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention, as well as the prohibition on the return of persons to places where they are likely to be tortured, under the 1984 Convention Against Torture, HRW believes."
Special on Afghan refugees,"Afghans have been streaming into Iran for decades, fleeing war, despotic leaders, fanatical regimes and economic misery. In 2000 alone, almost a quarter of a million Afghans sought refuge in Iran from the feared Taliban rulers. In this special report, IRIN examines the plight and challenges facing Afghans living in Iran, which alongside Pakistan, remains one of the largest host countries to the Afghan diaspora today. FACTS Iran has one of the largest Afghan refugee populations in the world. According to the Iranian interior ministry’s Bureau of Aliens and Foreign Immigrants Affairs (BAFIA), the coordinating body for refugee affairs, there were 2,349,068 Afghans living in Iran in April 2001, not including the thousands of Afghan migrant workers living illegally in the country. But for 20 years, the Iranian government has had an exemplary policy towards the refugees living amongst them. Unsupported by the international community they have spent millions of dollars on the Afghan refugee crisis. In fact, comparing the number of refugees that have been living in Iran to the number taken by western countries, and comparative wealth figures, Tehran has shouldered a large part of the burden on its own. Since the beginning of a joint voluntary repatriation programme in April 2002 under the facilitation of the office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) over 750,000 Afghan refugees have returned to their homeland, over 70,000 since April this year alone. The repatriation process in Iran takes place within the framework of a tripartite agreement, known as the Joint Programme, between the Iranian government, the Afghan authorities and the UN refugee agency. The first joint programme covered a one-year period until the end of March 2003. The second joint programme covers the period from the end of March 2003 to the end of March 2005. The main aims of the Joint Programme are to ensure that repatriation is voluntary, takes place with dignity and is bolstered by assistance towards reintegration once in Afghanistan. TORBAT-E-JAM REFUGEE CAMP Unlike Pakistan, the vast majority of Afghan refugees do not live in refugee camps but are largely integrated into Iranian society. Most live in the larger urban areas of the country like the capital Tehran, although seven refugee camps are still in existence. Built 10 years ago with a capacity of 10,000 people, Torbat-e-Jam refugee camp looks more like a suburban housing complex than a refugee camp. With wide shrub-lined avenues, several parks, a football field, a gym, and a bazaar it is often described as one of the best refugee camps in the world. Some 5,300 Afghans currently live in Torbat-e-Jam, housed in the 928 houses that line the roads. Some 1,450 students attend the camp school, which has 117 Iranian teachers. The longest-serving residents have been here for 10 years, with many of the male breadwinners having special permission to leave the camp to pick pistachios in nearby fields. But despite the comforts, for some this does not really feel like home. 

Young Hossein has been in Iran most of his life
""I don't know what the future holds. I don't know whether I want to stay in Iran or go to Afghanistan,"" Shireen, a 16-year old studying journalism, told IRIN. ""I realise that I have no real prospects - after I've done my journalism, I can't work in Iran as a journalist and what real job opportunities are there in Afghanistan?"" But in the bazaar, run by the refugees, the younger generations who have not known anywhere else are more positive. Hossein, aged 12, sits behind a sewing machine in one of the 40 shops in the market. He has been working with his father as a tailor for the past two years. ""I don't want to leave. All my friends are here. I like it here,"" he told IRIN, as his friends pop in to say hello. Hossein has been here most of his life - he says the prospect of returning to Afghanistan worries him. SULEYMANKHANI VOLUNTARY REPATRIATION CENTRE Many others, however, have opted to return. Standing under the blistering heat, hundreds of Afghans, clutching an assortment of documents, wait their turn at the Suleymankhani Voluntary Repatriation Centre(VRC) on the outskirts of Tehran. They wait until they are summoned, via loudspeaker, to be seen by staff member from BAFIA. For most Afghans here, this is the first step towards returning to a country that many of them cannot remember or even have never known - 31 percent of Afghan refugees were born in Iran. Mohsen Rezai is waiting for his exit permit to leave Iran. He is 29 years old and works in a gas cylinder factory in Tehran. ""My parents died in the war and I came to Iran - I've been here for 15 years. I want to stay in Iran. It's my home now, and I've got nothing in Afghanistan, nothing to go back to. But staying in Iran is no longer an option - they say we all have to go back,"" he told IRIN. ""It's tiring and it's hard,"" he explained. But through a screening process, UNHCR is working to ensure that repatriation is voluntary and protects Afghans who do not wish to be repatriated. A UNHCR member of staff said that there was a paucity of buses used to take the Afghans to the border. Some 24 buses a day leave Tehran for the 18-hour journey to the border. ""At the moment there's a transport issue - there are problems with the contractors - they're saying they can't provide enough buses,"" he told IRIN. ""So BAFIA has been giving the Afghans appointments to obtain their LPs [laissez-passer, the exit permit]. They de-register 4,000 Afghans a day and issue 700-800 LPs; so for the rest, they have to wait."" Abdul Ghai has been told his appointment is in two weeks. ""You get shuttled from one place to another,"" he told IRIN. In Afghanistan, Ghai worked as an army captain. In Iran he works as a builder. ""I've been building this country. Now I want to go back and help build my own,"" he said. He lost his parents when the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan. For the sake of his children, he decided to flee the war. 
[Iran] Afghans stand in line outside a VRC in the Iranian capital Tehran.
Afghans stand in line outside the Suleymankhani VRC in the Iranian capital Tehran.
There are 11 VRCs in Iran, specifically in place to aid the repatriation of Afghan refugees. Three new VRCs are being opened in Ahwaz, Kermanshah and Orumieh. Tehran has two VRCs as it is home to the largest Afghan population - in 2001 there were 791,800 Afghans living there; 374,800 Afghans live in the south-eastern province of Sistan Baluchestan; 238,300 live in the ancient city of Esfahan; and 225,800 in the eastern province of Khorasan. The bureaucratic process is lengthy - Afghans must undergo a series of formalities with BAFIA. Any refugee who was registered in 2001 by BAFIA must be de-registered to avoid a ""revolving door scenario"" - Afghans who slip back into Iran to re-enter the repatriation process in order to receive a second dose of benefits. BAFIA then issues exit permits, for which a fee is charged to every refugee. UNHCR is in negotiations with BAFIA to waive this exit fee, which is nearly US $6 per returnee, as this can add up to a considerable sum for a large family. The next step is a confidential interview with a UNHCR representative to check that the decision to return is really a voluntary one. Refugees are then informed of their rights under the repatriation programme and are given an overview of the situation in Afghanistan. At this stage, any vulnerable cases, such as the disabled, unaccompanied children, or female heads of households, are identified for special attention. If there are unaccompanied children, UNHCR contacts their offices in Afghanistan to begin the procedure of tracing their family. UNHCR then issues a voluntary repatriation form to serve as proof of the voluntary nature of the repatriation and a travel document to enter and stay in Afghanistan. PRESSURE TO LEAVE Meanwhile, many Afghans feel under pressure to leave, with benefits for Afghans being continually cut by the Iranian government. ""The status of Afghans is seen as having changed profoundly since the fall of the Taliban. The Iranian government believes that despite instability in Afghanistan, they no longer [need] fear persecution and therefore they are not obliged to give them the vast financial support they have been giving them,"" Angus McDowall, Tehran correspondent for the Middle East Economic Digest, told IRIN. The cuts are part of new regulations adopted by Tehran in February 2004, intended to induce increased repatriation. In line with this new strategy, UNHCR is cutting all educational assistance to Afghans in Iran by the end of this month, and is progressively reducing assistance towards health care throughout 2004. From September 2004 school fees will be compulsory for all Afghan children, and are expected to be at the same rate that Iranians must pay. It will also be obligatory to subscribe to health insurance schemes at full cost.

""Yes, we are decreasing medical assistance, but we want to maintain assistance for very vulnerable cases - those who can't be assisted on the other side of the border, like dialysis cases,"" Xavier Creach, external relations officer at UNHCR Tehran, told IRIN. Iranians will also be heavily penalised for employing illegal Afghan workers - a widespread problem in Iran. Afghans will also face new restrictions, such as residing in certain cities and regions, in obtaining mortgages, renting or owning property and opening bank accounts. A nominal tax for Afghans is also being discussed. The cuts are aimed at raising the cost of living for Afghans, making it less attractive for them to continue to extend their stay in Iran. This month, the entire education budget for Afghanistan in Iran will be carried over to Afghanistan with efforts increasingly concentrating on reconstruction in Afghanistan. With such diminishing opportunities, not surprisingly there are some Afghans who are looking forward to the long journey home. ""I left Kabul because of the war. But I want to return to Afghanistan. It's my country, it's where I want to die,"" 21-year-old Mohammad Saleh told IRIN. He has been living in Iran for the past 10 years, working as a builder on construction sites. From April to October 2003, the Iranian authorities conducted a re-registration process of the Afghan population in Iran against the payment of a fee of roughly US $5 per person. This re-registration process was only available to Afghans who had already registered with the authorities in 2001. Formal ID cards were issued, but with a limited validity of between three and six months. Some 1,450,000 Afghans have so far been re-registered. This April, BAFIA announced that it would not renew ID cards, although all Afghans with ID cards will be allowed to stay until at least 2005, when the tripartite agreement ends. DISPUTE SETTLEMENT COMMITTEES In a leafy suburb in west Tehran, in an unassuming concrete government building, is a Dispute Settlement Committee (DSC) - a mediation and arbitration system designed solely for the purpose of helping Afghans to solve legal disputes which keep them from leaving Iran. After lengthy negotiations between the Iranian government and UNHCR, BAFIA and UNHCR jointly opened DSCs in the seven most densely Afghan populated provinces in Iran - Shiraz, Esfahan, Kerman, Mashad, Qom, Zahedan and Tehran. The DSCs are an alternative to going to court. Each DSC is composed of a judge, a BAFIA representative, a representative from the Afghan community and a lawyer contracted by UNHCR.

Most of the cases are over rental agreements and back-payments of salaries. ""Afghans don't have time to wait to go through the court system - the system here is extremely slow and it could take up to two to three years just for a case to be heard,"" Helle Ankersen, a UNHCR protection officer told IRIN. ""Many cases are simply rental cases, with landlords taking advantage of the situation and not giving the Afghans their deposits back,"" she said. And if Iranians refuse to pay up, or refuse to attend the DSC, the Ministry of Labour gets involved. ""Having the authorities involved gives the DSCs credibility,"" Ankersen stressed. ""They simply point out to the Iranian landlord that they should have special permission to rent out their property to a foreigner - most of them don't, and so are willing to comply."" Afghan interest in the DSC has been overwhelming - 2,170 cases have been registered in Tehran so far, with up to 300 people registering a day. Some 200 cases have been dealt with already, of which 90 percent had positive outcomes for the Afghans. ""The fact that Afghans get their money back, and that it's very often an important sum of money - it's not $20 - can really make a difference to their lives in Afghanistan and will make reintegration much easier,"" Creach noted. The smallest sum of money claimed has been about $850 and the biggest about $14,500. REPATRIATION CENTRE AT DOGHAROUN BORDER EXIT STATION Everyday, nearly 4,000 Afghans arrive at the border exit station of Dogharoun in north-eastern Iran, tired after the 18-hour bus journey from Tehran. Some 90 percent of all Afghans enter Afghanistan from Dogharoun. Under a giant corrugated-iron shelter they sit, shaded from the searing heat, with belongings scattered around them, a short shuttle-bus ride away from ""point zero"" and an uncertain future in an unstable country. Many of them are going back to nothing. At point zero - where Iran and Afghanistan meet, a family of Afghans is crossing the border on foot, carting wheelbarrows filled with everything they own. They are ""spontaneous returnees"", who have decided to go back without any formal assistance. 
[Iran] UNHCR tents in Dogharoun on the border.

For people who arrive too late, there is basic accommodation - scores of cocoon-like mud-brick rooms line the central waiting area. At peak time, over 3,000 Afghans congregate here, entitled to a piece of bread each and a blanket, a hot meal and breakfast for overnight stays. ""I feel happy that I am going back,"" 22-year-old Abdullah Rezai told IRIN. ""I want a calm, safe life. I want an education. That's all I want,"" he said. ""The main problem we have here is missing returnees - some have been left behind. Or we get one member of a family who is undocumented - usually a small child or an elderly person who was either not born at the time of registration or too old and ill to go,"" a UNHCR worker told IRIN. ""In these cases we have an agreement with BAFIA that undocumented members of otherwise documented families are free to go,"" he added. Before leaving for the border, all Afghans must attend a mine-awareness workshop, given by Afghan instructors and arranged by an NGO, Ansar Relief Institute. In separate classes for men, women and children, they are shown various types of mines and watch an educational film about mine safety. The workshops have been a success - when the project was launched in 1994, 24 people were being injured by mines daily. After a year of mine-awareness training, that figure dropped to 10 every 24 hours. Finally, the Afghans are given provisions to take with them - cooking equipment and basic rations. And in a separate UNHCR holding tent, there are special packages including tents for Afghans who are returning from the earthquake-stricken city of Bam, which was razed to the ground last December. ""Officially there have been about 600 Afghans returning from Bam, although there were 3,500 Afghans registered in the city. Many of them lost everything in the earthquake,"" Creach said. DOGHAROUN SCREENING CENTRE The screening process is for illegal migrants who are arrested in the street and deported on the grounds of their illegal stay. Dogharoun is the last chance deportees have of being allowed to stay. In a small brick building is a screening centre, set up after long negotiations. Iran has taken the unprecedented step of allowing UNHCR to veto deportations of illegal migrants who would feel persecution upon return. The UNHCR screening programme started in May to look into deportation cases - all deportees are entitled to an interview with UNHCR. ""This gives undocumented deportees a chance to present a refugee claim. Also it gives us a chance to double-check that documented deportees are not on the bus that crossed the border,"" Creach said. ""There are cases of Afghans arrested on the streets who don't have their documents with them - they tell us they have their cards at home, so they should not be deported,"" he explained. According to a former agreement with the Iranian government, UNHCR does not have access to Afghans whose deportation was ordered by a court of law. There are ongoing discussions with the judiciary for UNHCR to have access to court cases, which accounts for 14 percent of deportees. ""The screening process is essential as we have to make sure that deportees are not refugees,"" Creach said. About 14 percent are vulnerable cases - children and disabled, and 1 percent are single women, travelling on their own. Between 10 and 200 Afghans are screened per day. Deportation rates are on the increase in Iran - a fact which worries UNHCR. ""Illegal migrants cannot use the buses that the registered Afghan refugees with ID cards can use. So they must make their own way to the border and what we are seeing happening is that they get arrested for being illegal and what started as a voluntary decision to go back is turning into a deportation,"" Creach said. Such Afghans are often sent to detention centres for illegal migrants, where they must languish until their paperwork is sorted out. The buses were once available to illegal Afghans, and BAFIA has not given a reason for stopping this arrangement. THE FUTURE UNHCR is concentrating its efforts on the reintegration of Afghans in their own country and is taking steps to ameliorate the process. The UN refugee agency plans to double transport capacity for returnees' belongings and are offering new incentives for Afghans to return - Afghan teachers from Bamyan living in Iran have been told they will be given shelter if they move back.

If the UNHCR planning figure of half a million returns is achieved this year, it will leave a population of about 900,000 Afghans in Iran at the end of the tripartite agreement. There were about 800,000 Afghan workers in Iran in 1979, when the first refugee arrived. Most of those who will not have repatriated by March 2005 are concerned by the socioeconomic conditions rather than by the security situation - Afghanistan being one of the poorest countries in the world today. Meanwhile, some Iranian economists are warning that with such an exodus of Afghan workers, there could be implications for Iran as it is losing a vital part of its workforce. UNHCR has identified this problem and is currently in talks with the Iranian government in the hope of establishing a temporary migration agreement between the two countries, allowing the breadwinner to come back to Iran to earn money for a short period. ""A migration framework is inherent to the development of political and socioeconomic relations between the two countries. It would create a win-win situation for Afghanistan and Iran,"" Philippe Lavanchy, UNHCR head of mission, said. ""Afghans could make a positive contribution to the Iranian economy,"" he added. But with such a slow pace of reconstruction, such an unstable political climate and a huge developmental gap between Iran and Afghanistan, with much higher standards of living in Iran, the future is fraught with challenges for returning Afghans from Iran."
Iraqi refugees face bleak existence,"After fleeing the war in Iraq, life has not been easy for the Iraqi refugees who've been staying in the desert area of Jordan over the past 10 months. Besides experiencing all kind of general problems while living in refugee camps, such as the winter winds and living in tents without proper supplies, some of them have had to face even worse. Walking around the Al-Ruweished camp, housing some 420 refugees, some 350 km east of Amman and managed by the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation (JHCO), it's clear that life is tough. Inside five-year-old Malek's tent, which moves dangerously due to strong desert winds, her father Zuheir Salan told IRIN that they had been in the refugee camp for the last 10 months, and during their stay Malek had had two brain operations outside the camp. He was later told that available funds for his daughter had finished, and she was sent back to the refugee camp. He said that the general conditions in the camp worsened her health. ""No, she is not well enough to stay in a refugee camp,"" Nabeela Sweis, a community service assistant at the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told IRIN in Amman. Nabeela explained that Malek's family case was being considered as an urgent one for a lasting solution in a third country, where they could settle, but the process would take time. ""I hope she will be strong enough to wait,"" Malak's mother told IRIN, almost without any hope in her voice. A single woman in a refugee camp, Sameeha Nur, 27, has had to face some severe problems too. She said that she was sexually harassed in the camp. ""We are aware of her case. She was consulted by the Community Service,"" Said Al-Omari, a UNHCR protection assistant, told IRIN. ""The security of the camp is the government's responsibility,"" Dawaree Kanachanaphet, head of the UNHCR office in Al-Ruweished camp, added. Nasr Batanieh, camp director on behalf of JHCO, explained that they were doing their best in order to provide security, and voiced another concern, saying that the main problem was that the refugees did not know what would happen to them and when, so that they were becoming increasingly nervous and depressed. Dr Suleiman, who was appointed by the Jordanian Ministry of Health, also told IRIN that many refugees were suffering from depression due to the general camp conditions. Similar stories were heard at the Al-Karama Refugee Camp, housing 1,161 refugees, approximately 80 km from the Al-Ruweished camp, which was established in no-man's land between the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. ""It is difficult to bring up a child without any hope in the future,"" a mother at the Al-Karama Camp told IRIN while a strong sandstorm started to make her cough. Talking on behalf of the Iranian Kurds, who form the majority of the camp's population, 23-year-old Tharwat Bin Ahli said that they felt neglected. He added that they needed additional aid. ""We fled from a possible quick death by a bullet, and came here to undergo a slow death"", Taleb Waheed, a 35-year-old, Palestinian Iraqi, told IRIN. However, the manager of Al-Karama camp, Ibrahim Tarabeiyeh, said that all the basic humanitarian needs of the refugees were completely covered, but the refugees were asking for more. Meanwhile, Jacqueline Parlevliet, a senior protection officer at the UNHCR office in Amman told IRIN that 1,048 Iranian Kurds had already been granted refugee status, under the mandate of UNHCR in Iraq. ""They are already refugees. We are not questioning their cases, but we are trying to find which solution-box they would fit in. We can offer these people three options: repatriation to the country where they came from, local integration as we have been discussing with the Kurds in northern Iraq, or asylum in a third country,"" she explained. The Jordanian Government has agreed to keep Al-Ruweished camp open until April."
Focus on Somali refugees,"""I tried to get on deck and I was beaten. That's how my arms were broken. It was hot and crowded in the bottom of the boat and I thought I was going to suffocate,"" Mohammed Noor, a Somali refugee now living in a camp in the Yemeni province of Aden, told IRIN. He paid US $100 to smugglers to get him to Yemen, involving a 24-hour journey from the Horn of Africa. The young man described the gruelling journey in which he travelled to Bosaso on the coast of Somalia and then to Bir Ali in Yemen, 300 km across the Gulf of Aden. ""There were 118 people on board that night and three of them died,"" he explained. But Noor said his journey was worth it. Having been at the camp for only a month, he said his life was much better now. ""I left Somalia because of the war. I could not take it any more. There was tribal fighting in my village,"" he said. Without her husband, but carrying three children in her arms, Fatimah Alim made a similar journey across the sea to Yemen. ""I want to go to Saudi Arabia. My husband is working there,"" she told IRIN, adding that she would not go until she could get enough money together for the journey. Asked if she was aware that she could be deported from neighbouring countries, she replied: ""Yes I know. It has happened to friends and they keep trying to cross the border. Some have managed to get in so there is some hope for us,"" she explained.

Others were not too keen on staying in the camp ""I miss my homeland and I want to go back,"" a mother of four, Khadija Mohammed, told IRIN. Originally from the Somali capital, Mogadishu, she had been living in the camp since 1991. For many Somali refugees fleeing their land, where there has been no central government and sporadic fighting for more than a decade, the journey to a better life is often not what they expected it to be. ""Smugglers just throw some of the refugees off the boats when they see the port is near so they are not caught. Some drown,"" External Relations Assistant at the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Abdul Malik Abboud, told IRIN in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a. ""It is very difficult for the Yemeni government to control the 2,800 km coastline on its own without being supported by the world community. Yet, even though the country is poor, it is still accepting new arrivals, compared to other Arab nations who do not accept as many refugees,"" he added. STATUS Somalis are the largest refugee community in Yemen with some 47,000 co-registered by the government and UNHCR. Some 10,000 are living in camps and the rest are in cities such as Aden and Taiz in the north of the country. There are also small groups of Ethiopian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Eritreans and Sudanese refugees, but Somalis are in a very favourable position when it comes to granting refugee status as it is given on a prima face basis, as Yemen is signatory to the 1951 Convention on the Rights of Refugees. The moment Somalis arrive, if they register, they are given an identity card. This entitles them to access health facilities, education and food supplies originally provided by the World Food Programme (WFP). UNHCR plans to open six permanent registration centres for refugees across the country to avoid any discrimination and to ensure they can be protected until the situation in their countries of origin allows them to voluntarily repatriate. CAMP SUPPORT The Kharaz camp, 120 km from the southern city of Aden, is home to some 11,000 mainly Somali and Ethiopian refugees, according to UNHCR. It is the biggest camp in the country and although it is fairly well resourced, conditions can be harsh. ""The weather is worse in the camp and there can be dust storms which cause havoc,"" UNHCR field assistant Mohammed Tahir al-Jaseem told IRIN in Aden.

""The other camps were closer to the road, so they could travel to get work,"" he added, referring to previous camp locations as refugees are only able to get irregular daily labour. Refugees living in cities can find work as domestic labourers, on farms or as tailors. In order to avoid any disputes between the local population and the refugees, food assistance is also offered to some 1,200 people from vulnerable groups of local people immediately outside the camp. Supported by the UN, two international and two local NGOS, refugees are given different identity cards to the local population so they can collect food aid on a monthly basis, which includes oil, flour and sugar supplied by WFP. Water and electricity have also been extended to nearby villages. ""This reduces any tensions and prevents interference in the camp,"" al-Jaseem added. With some 800 houses on site, the camp is well served with water points, food distribution and rubbish collection. There is also a community centre, a workshop to teach carpentry skills, schools and clinics. Some refugees end up staying here and others move on into villages to find work or leave for neighbouring countries such as Oman or Saudi Arabia in search of a more prosperous life, but are often deported, al-Jaseem explained. UNHCR registers refugees at the Maifa reception centre on the Yemeni coastline where most enter the country and then provides transport to the camp as well as meals. ""We have had an additional 150 families this year coming to the camp and we need to build more accommodation for them,"" he said, citing future needs. As in other camps worldwide the issue of protection for refugees is of great importance and although sexual violence is not common in this camp, according to aid workers, domestic violence is. ""We try and get the adults to reach a solution to end the problem and have been successful in most cases,"" said one female worker at the camp. Ultimately what most of the refugees want is resettlement, aid workers say. The UNHCR resettlement programme specifically targets groups looking for family reunification, women at risk, unaccompanied children and those with special needs on medical grounds in conformity with UNHCR resettlement criteria. ""I want to go to Europe. That is where I see my future,"" Somali refugee Mohammed Qudsi told IRIN at the camp."
Iraqi refugee camp closed,"One of the largest camps to host Iraqi refugees in Iran closed over the weekend, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) confirmed. ""It went very smoothly,"" UNHCR spokeswoman in the Iranian capital, Tehran, Marie-Helene Verney, told IRIN on Monday. The remaining 205 refugees in the Ashrafi camp, located 150 km north of Ahvaz, the capital of the southwestern Kuzestan province, were transported back to their homeland via the Shalamshea border crossing on Saturday. ""The convoy was escorted by CPA troops,"" she explained. The camp was home to some 12,000 Iraqis, many of whom had lived there for more than a decade following the first Gulf war in 1991. There were some 200,000 Iraqi refugees living in Iran last year, of which approximately 50,000 have returned home, according to rough estimates. Although UNHCR is assisting refugees to return, Verney stressed that this was not a repatriation programme in the normal sense. ""This is not a full repatriation programme as conditions are not right for refugees to return. However, so many were desperate to return by themselves and were in need of assistance over a heavily mined border that we decided to help them,"" she added. Under the UNHCR programme, which started in November, refugees are give US $20 and free transportation to the southern Iraqi city of Basra. UNHCR has a very limited presence inside Iraq due to the security situation there, making it very difficult for a repatriation programme, such as the one in Afghanistan, to operate. So far the refugee agency has helped more than 2,000 Iraqi's in Iran to return home. ""Many have gone back on their own, through a heavily mined area which concerns us,"" she added. Meanwhile, returns of Iraqi refugees from other parts of the country are continuing, with some two convoys per week heading for the border with Iran."
Refugee protest turns ugly,"A refugee camp in southwestern Ghana was under tight security on Wednesday a day after police fired teargas and warning shots to quell rioting that left buildings and vehicles burned and some refugees on the run from the law. Over the course of the last week, close to 800 of Krisan refugee camp’s 1,700 residents had set out on foot for the nearby Ivorian border to protest their living conditions and to push for the right to settle in a third country other than Ghana and their homeland. On Tuesday, Ghanaian officials bussed the refugees back to the camp near the coastal town of Axim but, upon their return, violence broke out. “We had to run for our dear lives,” said Padmore Nyankopa-Arthur, the regional representative for the ministry of interior. “Even the police had to tactically retreat before we called for reinforcements.” “But by that time, the mayhem had already been caused and the leaders had absconded.” Some refugees disagree with Nyankopa-Arthur’s account of a professional police overwhelmed by the irrational behaviour of a mob incited to violence by a small number of rabble-rousers. Instead, they speak of brutal security forces beating people and dragging them before forcing them back to the camp they had fled. However, both sides agree on the end result: a badly damaged camp and an unknown number of refugees on the run. “I’m wanted by security forces,” Kennedy Vanyan told IRIN by telephone from his hiding place. “If I’m caught right now, I’m a dead body,” said Vanyan, who estimated that 400 refugees were too scared to return to the camp. West Africa is home to about 1.3 million displaced people, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Of the more than 60,000 refugees in Ghana, some of whom have lived in camps for over a decade, the vast majority are Liberian and Togolese. “If we could leave Ghana, we’d be very happy,” said Vanyan who fled the civil war in his native Liberia in 1992 and came to Ghana from Cote d’Ivoire 10 years later when fighting started up there. There is a perception within Krisan camp that refugees from certain countries, namely Sudan and Sierra Leone, are more likely to benefit from a resettlement programme to a third country. According to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), which works with Ghana’s government to provide refugees with food, shelter and education, resettlement to countries like the United States and Australia is one of three durable solutions for displaced people. But it is far less common than repatriation to the country of origin or integration into the host society, as only one percent of refugees ultimately find a home in a third country that offers asylum. “Resettlement is not something you claim,” said Needa Jehu-Hoyah, public information officer for UNHCR in Ghana’s capital Accra. “You cannot just walk into a place and say resettle me.” Furthermore, the UNHCR said that, although financial constraints make it very difficult to provide adequately for large refugee populations, Krisan camp is one of the few in West Africa to meet established international standards. Refugees have been living at Krisan since 1996, and officially UNHCR consider the site a settlement with semi-permanent structures, shops and businesses much like any large village. However, the relatively high standards at Krisan provide little consolation for many of the camp’s refugees. “People are discouraged, they are fed up,” Franskkgav Freejust, one of the camp’s leaders told IRIN from his hide-out “somewhere in the bush”, adding that refugees want to move on from years of uncertainty. “People are fighting for the future.”"
Refugees tell of horror in Andijan,"Teshik-Tash is an isolated hill district 25 km west of the capital of the southern Kyrgyz province of Jalal-Abad, situated on the banks of the Kara-Darya river. The community, lying close to the Kyrgyz border with Uzbekistan, is now home to around 500 Uzbeks who fled the violence in eastern Uzbekistan over the past four days. The bedraggled group, some wounded and others sick, sit munching flat, Central Asian bread, while sheltering in hastily-erected tents designed to accommodate much smaller numbers. “There is not enough space for all of us but we are not complaining. We are thankful for this. At least, the local Kyrgyz authorities gave us shelter and refuge,” Zuhra, a young women, told IRIN. “A lack of basic amenities here is better than persecution at home.” The bloodshed in eastern Uzbekistan started early on Friday when between 60 and 100 armed men stormed the local prison to free 23 inmates accused of belonging to an illegal group related to the Hizbut Tahrir Islamic movement. They also released some 2,000 other prisoners. Thousands of people in the city, located in the impoverished and densely populated Ferghana valley, had been demonstrating against the trial of the 23 freed men. They claimed all the charges against the group had been trumped up by the government. After the prison breakout, the gunmen seized public buildings, while a crowd of about 5,000 supporters demonstrated outside against the government. Security forces opened fire on the crowd, killing hundreds, witnesses said. In her home city of Andijan, Zuhra was a housewife. She went to the demonstration on Friday with her husband and four children. When police and soldiers began shooting at the group, killing hundreds according to human rights groups, Zuhra and her family fled, along with hundreds of other people. Many of the refugees began crying when recalling what they had experienced on Friday night, when up to a thousand frightened people rushed to the border to escape the slaughter in Andijan. “We heard on the radio and TV that President [Islam] Karimov had come to Andijan and we gathered on the main square to tell him about all our problems but the president did not talk to us. We got bullets instead,” Shahodit Miftahiddinova, an elderly woman, told IRIN, shivering as she recalled the bloody events of four days ago. Kyrgyz soldiers guard the improvised camp for the “asylum seekers” as local migration service officials refer to them. There is a long queue of people waiting to get water from a truck bringing in fresh supplies from Jalal-Abad. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been assisting those who fled the disturbances. ""UNHCR has provided 540 refugees blankets, soaps, canisters for potable water, hygiene sets, clothes, utensils. Today, we will start the provision of food to the refugees,” UNHCR programme officer, Almaz Burkutov, told IRIN. Three of the tents at the makeshift refugee camp have been given over to women. Girls sit across the laps of mothers and elderly female relatives. “When the shooting started the crowd was terrified and everyone fled, stepping on each other. We followed those people who wanted to get to Kyrgyzstan,” one of the women said. A neighbour in the next tent said they had walked all night to the border, leaving those too badly injured or exhausted to their fate in villages on the way. “Only God knows what will happen to them, the soldiers will get them,” the woman added. Shahodit Miftahiddinova, an elderly woman running a food stall near Andijan’s central square, was caught up in the violence and also fled when her friends were gunned down by security forces. “In the morning we reached the border but our [Uzbek]soldiers started shooting us. They fired on innocent people and injured some of us, we will never forgive them for that,” she said. Bilaldin, 14, went to the demonstration on Friday with his mother, grandfather and brother. He told IRIN that the only thing he wanted was that the authorities release his father from prison. Bilaldin said he was convicted by an Uzbek court for allegedly being a member of the radical Islamic religious group, Hizbut Tahrir. “I do not want to go back home – there they will shoot us again,” he whispered, wiping tears from his dusty face. According to local officials, there are now 541 people in the camp, some elderly. There is a total of 90 women and 15 children. Seven Uzbek refugees were wounded but managed to escape in spite of their injuries and they are being cared for by doctors at the nearby Suzak district hospital. Many of the refugees are relatives and friends of those convicted and jailed by Uzbek authorities for alleged links with illegal Islamic groups. Tavakkil Hojaev, the 28-year-old informal leader of the “asylum seekers”, told IRIN that the majority of the group on trial in Andijan were either businessmen who had been targeted by Tashkent, or their employees or family members. “Sure it was the businessmen who initiated recent popular protests in Andijan. They led people who were dissatisfied with Karimov’s regime. Some were traders, some were people who had been persecuted for their religious beliefs but the majority were simply people who have been forced into dire poverty by Karimov,” Hojaev said. Local people living close to the new camp said they were concerned for their safety as they had heard some of the refugees might be among the 2000 convicts who had been freed on Thursday night in Andijan by the armed assault on the prison. “The very first day there were reports that 13 people in group had been imprisoned and were serving their terms but we do not know what they had been convicted of,” Nazarov, deputy head of the Suzak district of the Jalal-Abad province, told IRIN. “But for us, they are all people suffering a lot and in need of help,” he added. On Monday, officials from several international organisations were on the ground, promising assistance. Others wer standing by. ""Basic needs are being covered by the local authorities and the United Nations. We are monitoring the situation and are ready to provide humanitarian aid if necessary"", Marko Yaminki, deputy of the International Red Crescent Committee in Kyrgyzstan, told IRIN from the capital, Bishkek. Salima Ismailova, regional head of the Kyrgyz migration department, told IRIN that local authorities were assisting the new arrivals and that local people had spontaneously offered food and medicine. “These people are not strangers. This region is very mixed ethnically,” the migration official observed. Uzbekistan's chief prosecutor said on Tuesday 169 people died in clashes between protesters and troops in Andijan. The figure was much higher than previous government estimates but still below eyewitness estimates that hundreds of people died. Foreign diplomats and media were due to see for themselves the situation in Andijan – on a trip organised by the government. But the excursion was postponed to Wednesday, to give authorities time to remove evidence of the extent of the killings in the city, Uzbek and international human rights groups have said."
Repatriation of refugees nears completion,"The repatriation of Angolan refugees from camps and settlements in the region is drawing to a close, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has said. ""By the end of October, virtually all refugees should have returned and UNHCR convoys and airlifts will stop,"" the agency said in a statement. More than 300,000 Angolans have returned home since 2002, either on UNHCR convoys and airlifts or on their own steam. The agency noted that on arrival in Angola, the returnees receive a UNHCR reintegration package with basic non-food items such as building materials and agricultural tools as well as one months' food rations from the World Food Programme. ""We plan to repatriate another 53,000 Angolans during the next seven months. After that, the three-year period of assisted repatriation will be concluded. As of 2006, UNHCR will not provide transport but we will still offer repatriation packages for those who return spontaneously,"" Annette Nyekan, UNHCR's acting representative in Angola, was quoted as saying. As in all major repatriation operations, a residual group might decide not to return home for various reasons, UNHCR said. ""These individuals are usually locally settled and well integrated in their countries of asylum,"" noted Nyekan. A group of 3,000 refugees in the Republic of Congo have not yet decided to repatriate. Most of them originate from the Angolan enclave of Cabinda, where sporadic clashes between the Angolan army and separatist groups continue. BEYOND 2005 Once its repatriation programme has ended, UNHCR will shift focus ""from bringing people back home to making their return sustainable"", according to Jose Samaniego, head of the agency's Angolan unit. He referred to the agency's four R strategy: Repatriation, Reintegration, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction. ""The first R is nearly done, now we are concentrating on the other three,"" Samaniego said. The majority of the refugees are returning to isolated and remote areas in Moxico, Cuando Cubango, Zaire and Uige, which were the four provinces worst affected by the three decades long war. Returning refugees often find themselves in a difficult situation. Large parts of the country are littered with landmines. The infrastructure has been destroyed by the war, basic services are lacking and job opportunities are scarce. UNHCR's policy for 2006 will help to bridge the ""relief to development"" gap which regularly occurs in post-conflict situations as relief funds dry up but development aid is not yet forthcoming. The agency said its operational budget reflected this change in the focus of its activities. ""This year, US $10 million is being divided evenly between repatriation activities and general reintegration, whereas in 2006 the bulk of the budget will be allocated for reintegration projects,"" the agency said. ""We need to assist the population of those areas which are most affected by refugee returns,"" added Samaniego. A UNHCR technical expert has been working with the Angolan government and liaising with other UN agencies and donors to develop a reintegration framework for key areas of return. ""Planning is done in a three-step process: Once the needs are identified by the ministries and UNHCR, projects are developed locally. The local administration and the sobas (traditional leaders) of the area are involved to make sure that the plans really meet the needs of the population. Only then are the donors asked for funding,"" UNHCR said. UNHCR-supported projects cover a wide range of areas, including water and sanitation, health, education, income generation and road repairs. While the agency has been concentrating its efforts more and more on the post-return phase, ""the repatriation clock is counting down"". However, UNHCR pointed out that the current outbreak of acute hemorrhagic fever in Uige province in northern Angola threatens the start of returns to Sakamdica and possibly Lunda Norte. The highly contagious disease, called Marburg virus, has reportedly claimed 96 lives so far, and for the time being, the UN has suspended all non-essential travel to Uige province. Meanwhile, convoys and airlifts from neighbouring countries to other Angolan provinces will continue once the rainy season ends in April/May."
Refugee returns to south continue,"Another 500 Iraqis were assisted in returning from Iran on Monday as part of a continuous flow of returnees from the Islamic Republic this year. ""With this group of returnees from Iran, the total number of Iraqi returnees either from Rafah camp in Saudi Arabia or from Iran so far in 2004 is around 5,900 people, of which the majority are from Iran,"" Josef Pfattner, aid worker from Intersos, an Italian NGO funded by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told IRIN in Basra. ""This is of course in addition to thousands of spontaneous (unassisted) returnees who come on their own,"" he added. According to UNHCR, an estimated 120,000 people have returned to southern Iraq spontaneously - mainly from Iran. Since last July the refugee agency has helped the repatriation of some 10,000 Iraqis from Iran, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Earlier, Iran hosted the largest number of Iraqi refugees in the world at around 202,000, most of whom fled during the late 1970s and 1980s, escaping war and persecution, with many also arriving following the 1991 Gulf war. While UNHCR is not promoting returns, officials at the agency say they would rather facilitate returns then allow refugees, desperate to return, to cross dangerously mined areas themselves. The returnees arrive home fairly late in the day due to bureaucratic procedures at the borders and often look exhausted from the 14-hour-drive from the nearest border city in Iran, which is 40 km away from Basra. Abbas al-Saghair, who had been in Iran since 1993 and had married an Iranian woman, said that he would have preferred to stay in Iran but he was forced to come back like the rest of his family for economic reasons. ""I can't stay away from the rest of my big family especially now that the situation in Iran is not that stable either, there is not enough work unless you have a special skill or are well-educated,"" he told IRIN. Soad Haider, a woman from the neighbouring Iraqi district of Amara in Missan governorate, who left for Iran with her husband and two children in 1991, said they too had no regular income in Iran. ""I was so worried to come back home in this unstable security situation, but we had no other alternative. My husband came a few weeks ago on his own to check on the situation and he told me we would be safe,"" she told IRIN. ""Most of the returnees endure very difficult social, economic and health conditions,"" Dr Ali al-Jabri, with Intersos told IRIN. ""Many of them suffer from those illnesses linked to stress and hard economic conditions like headaches, high blood pressure, diabetes, and many of their children suffer from anaemia and tonsillitis,"" he added. The Intersos programme includes the distribution of non-food items and making links between vulnerable returnees, such as the disabled and elderly, with national and international NGOs in the south, as well as local authorities such as the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. ""We were first helping the most vulnerable returnees till we found many Iraqis in the south who were even more vulnerable, so we expanded the programme to help vulnerable Iraqis in general,"" Pfattner explained. On Friday, UNHCR issued a statement saying that more than 30,000 extremely vulnerable returnees in the Thi-Qar governorate of Basra had received assistance in the form of blankets, plastic sheeting, cooking stoves and kitchen sets. The refugee agency also expressed concern over the recent escalation in violence inside Iraq with regard to returns. ""The violence in Falluja this week once again demonstrates the overall volatility of the situation, as well as the dangers faced by people inside the country, nationals and foreigners alike,"" said UNHCR spokesman, Ron Redmond at a press briefing in Geneva. On Monday, US troops launched an offensive against Iraqi insurgents protesting in the Sunni town of Falluja, some 50 km west of Baghdad. Four Americans were killed and their bodies mutilated by a mob in the town on 25 March. At least nine coalition soldiers and 46 Iraqis have been killed in confrontations related to the protests, while continuing tension in Sadr City, a district of Baghdad, saw eight US troops and a reported 22 Iraqis killed in fighting on Sunday, the international media reported."
Congolese granted asylum,"The Rwandan government granted asylum on Friday to 283 people of Rwandan decent whom officials in Kigali have classified as refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""At the moment we are looking after them in a refugee camp, Protais Mitali, the Rwandan minister for regional cooperation,"" said. The group - 172 children, 62 women and 49 men - were expelled from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo earlier in the week. Local military and civilian officials in the Congo had accused them of being Rwandans. Mitali said the international community must step in and stop what he described as the ongoing persecution of ""Rwandafones"" (Congolese speakers of the Rwandan Kinyarwanda language) in parts of Congo’s North and South Kivu provinces. ""We have alerted the United Nations and ambassadors from the permanent five to look into the matter,"" he said, referring to the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Congolese authorities had rounded up the refugees from their homes in the town of Kalehe in South Kivu, according to the Rwandan government. The refugees had been detained for two weeks in a military camp in Bunyakiri then transported in trucks to Rwanda by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. An official of the UNHCR confirmed that all 283 people are second-generation Congolese nationals of Rwandan origin. Their parents migrated to Congo before independence to work as farmers or miners, a UNHCR official in Bukavu told IRIN on Tuesday. The official said many were going to Rwanda for the first time. Ethnic tensions have risen sharply in Congo, with a wave of hostility directed at Congolese Tutsis of Rwandan origin, also known as Banyamulenge. Many fled into neighbouring Burundi and Rwanda in early June when fighting intensified between dissident and loyal government forces, and when the dissident soldiers loyal to Gen Laurent Nkunda and Col Jules Mutebutsi seized control of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu."
Big Afghan refugee camp to close,"Pakistani authorities are soon to close the large, well-established Jalozai Afghan refugee camp, home to 120,000 people and located in the Nowshera district of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province (NWFP), some 140 km northwest of the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. ""On account of security concerns the camp has only been identified for closure. However, the formal closure will be announced only after consultation with the government of Afghanistan and the UN refugee agency [the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)],"" Dr Imran Zeb, director of the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CAR), a state body dealing with Afghan refugees, said in Islamabad on Thursday. Of about 200 refugee facilities meant for Afghans fleeing the Soviet invasion of 1979 and, later, internal strife inside Afghanistan, Pakistan now has only around 70 camps housing over 1 million refugees, mainly administered by UNHCR. Including Jalozai, there are currently four Afghan refugee camps facing closure for what Islamabad refers to as “security concerns”. Two of the camps are located in the southwestern province of Balochistan, home to 63,000 Afghans. The third is in NWFP, located in the provincial capital of Peshawar and housing 50,000 refugees. Since 2003, the closure of Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan has been proceeding alongside the repatriation operation that began in March 2002. Under the voluntary repatriation assistance programme of the UNHCR started in 2002, over 2.7 million Afghans have returned so far from Pakistan. Nearly 1.6 million repatriated in 2002, followed by some 340,000 in 2003 and more than 380,000 in 2004. This programme is governed by a tripartite agreement between Kabul, Islamabad and UNHCR that runs until December 2006. According to a comprehensive census of Afghans living in Pakistan carried out in March 2005, over 3 million Afghan nationals have been living in different parts of the country for over a quarter of a century. Many do not want to return to Afghanistan, citing insecurity, lack of jobs and infrastructure for their reluctance to leave their adopted country."
Minister promises better protection for refugees,"The South African government has promised to amend policies and practices to better protect the rights of refugees. Addressing the International Conference for Women and Family Restructuring in Cape Town this week, Minister of Home Affairs Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula acknowledged that there were limitations in current immigration policies and procedures. In a bid to end the ill treatment of more vulnerable refugees, such as women and girls, she promised to review them. Her comments were welcomed by human rights lawyer and spokesman for the Zimbabweans in Exile Forum, Gabriel Shumba. ""It has always been obvious that women refugees, in particular those with children, suffer the cruellest kind of treatment,"" Shumba told IRIN. In her presentation to the conference, Mapisa-Nqakula said, ""whilst, generally, there are problems that affect any immigrant who goes through our systems, certain categories of foreigners have had it worse than others, including women, children, asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants"". ""Not only do women constitute a large number of these refugees, but they are also the ones that experience the harshest treatment of abuse and humiliation, at times from officials whose duty it is to protect them. Most of the times, women are forced to flee their homes with children on their backs, without food, and very little guarantee of shelter and safety when they arrive at their supposed destinations,"" added Mapisa-Nqakula. The minister said she had ""always found it disturbing"" that policies were not sensitive to this. ""Women's issues are not isolated and given special attention in regulating the treatment and protection of refugees globally,"" she noted. Mapisa-Nqakula said it was important that governments that were signatories to United Nations and Organisation of African Unity conventions on refugees ""should concern themselves with issues such as counselling, safety, reproductive health issues and skills development for women"". The South African government had recently been criticised for its handling of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. Earlier this month about a 100 immigrants from Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia and Angola demonstrated at the Lindela Repatriation Centre outside Johannesburg. Joyce Dube, a director of the Southern African Women's Institute for Migration Affairs, a rights NGO, told IRIN at the time that ""South African authorities do not check whether the immigrants, particularly the Zimbabweans, are genuine asylum seekers - they merely arrest them and deport them"". There have been allegations of ill-treatment at the centre and complaints that immigrants did not have adequate access to sanitation. Mapisa-Nqakula said she had recently toured the Lindela Repatriation Centre. ""We did find that there are many women who get arrested and taken to the centre for deportation and, while they are kept isolated from the rest of the group, they were not prioritised for transfer to make sure that those who were pregnant, sick or with young children should not stay longer at the centre,"" she said. The national immigration branch was working on a policy ""that will guide the [home affairs] department in dealing with these specific cases"", Mapisa-Nqakula said. ""In the meantime we have directed that, where it is possible, these women should be given priority during such transfers,"" she added. Shumba said it was clear that current immigration practices were inadequate, ""especially given the treatment of refugees in Lindela"". ""When helping women secure asylum or responding to their humanitarian needs ... we reflect that there's a great need to treat women with sensitivity: they need special sanitation and hygienic considerations, for example,"" Shumba said. He added that refugees already enjoyed protection under domestic and international law. ""What must change is the attitude of the home affairs officials, and other officials that deal with refugees, rather than the laws themselves. We have adequate protection under the law ... what we need to see is a change of attitude, especially the xenophobic attitude exhibited towards refugees."""
UN refugee agency moves first group of CAR refugees to camp,"Trucks crawled along muddy roads on Wednesday, carrying the first group of thousands of Central African refugees from makeshift shelters inside Chad to a camp where they can regularly receive food and other assistance. Almost 100 refugees made the trek from the rural town of Betel to a camp in Gore, Mbaioren Djerassen of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) told IRIN by telephone. ""The roads are already very difficult to pass,"" Djerassen said, speaking from the Chadian capital, N'djamena. It took the UNHCR convoy about four hours to travel the 60 km to the Amboko camp in Gore. According to UNHCR estimates, about 10,000 CAR refugees are scattered across 17 villages inside Chad, having fled fighting between government forces and unidentified armed groups in early June. That is in addition to about 30,000 other refugees who have been living in camps in southern Chad since fleeing conflict in Central African Republic nearly three years ago. The June arrivals have had no access to safe drinking water or proper sanitation. Many have been living on wild fruits and roots. UNHCR has been in discussions with the Chadian government for weeks to ensure the refugees safe passage to a location where they can receive regular assistance. Last week the government gave the refugee agency the green light to move the refugees to Amboko, which is already home to 13,000 refugees. It has the capacity to house about 27,000 people. The government normally cuts truck access to most of the country’s roads throughout the rainy season to avoid further degradation, but UNHCR official Marie-Christiane Boccoum said the agency had received special permission for the convoy from the government. UNHCR started the relocations with the village of Betel, primarily because it has the largest population of refugees among the Chadian villages affected, Boccoum said. Betel, which has a local population of about 600, is now housing nearly 3,000 refugees. The 97 refugees that were moved on Wednesday have been registered and have begun receiving food rations and supplies, Djerassen said. UNHCR is working with the government and its NGO partners to restore the airstrip in Gore to allow for UN passenger planes to transport staff and supplies to the area, he added. It is impossible to know when all the refugees will be settled into Amboko camp, Djerassen explained, because it is difficult to factor in how much the rains will damage the roads. ""We cannot estimate how many days this will take,"" he said."
UN sanctions chief urges action,"The chairman of the UN Security Council sanctions committee for Cote d’Ivoire wrapped up a four-day visit on Friday by urging the warring parties to resolve the “serious problems” that have blocked the implementation of a succession of peace deals. The comments of Greek Ambassador Adamantios Vassilakis came as the UN Security Council in New York called on all sides to ""immediately comply"" with three peace deals signed since the country was divided by war in September 2002. “We hope that all parties will do their best to find a solution [but] there are problems and these problems are serious,” said Vassilakis, adding that he has urged the warring factions to act in good faith. “I am optimistic but at the same time I am aware that there are problems […] if there is goodwill and good faith you can easily overcome [the crisis], but if not, there is a problem. I insist that good faith is absolutely necessary,” he said. Rebels, known as the New Forces, staged a failed coup in September 2002 taking hold of the north half of Cote d’Ivoire. Repeated peace deals have paved the way for the disarmament of rebel and government militia forces but implimentation has been a recurring problem and this once a beacon of stability and economic prosperity remains divided by war. Vassilakis declined to say whether sanctions would be meted out against Ivorian leaders anytime soon, but warned instead that human rights violations were a “very serious problem” and had to be curtailed. The UN, earlier this month, reported that human rights abuses were on the rise on both sides of the confidence zone – the strip of land monitored by French and UN peacekeeping soldiers that keeps the warring government and rebel forces apart. Last November, the UN Security Council approved individual sanctions such as travel bans or asset freezes against anyone seen as blocking the peace process, violating human rights or inciting hatred, but so far no sanctions have been imposed to enable mediators to try to solve the three-year-old crisis. Diplomats told IRIN that sanctions would only be used as a last resort in combating the intransigence of some of the key players. Vassilakis hinted that a lack of goodwill on both sides had delayed the implementation of the 2003 French-brokered Marcoussis peace plan. “Peace is possible – it suffices that everybody takes the necessary steps,” Vassilakis said. During his visit Vassilakis met with President Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the New Forces rebels Guillaume Soro, Prime Minister Seydou Diarra and former president Henri Konan Bedie. While Vassilakis was talking in the economic capital Abidjan, the UN Security Council ended a week of discussions on Cote d’Ivoire by demanding action on a string of peace deals in France, Ghana and most recently, South Africa. The Security Council has supported African Union proposals to allow Gbagbo to remain in power for up to 12 months beyond the end of his mandate, which expires when presidential elections should have been held on the 30 October. The AU, backed by the UN, has asked Gbagbo to appoint a new prime minister who would be mutually agreeable to all the warring parties to lead the country to reorganised polls. AU Chairman, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and South African President Thabo Mbeki – who has lead mediations in Cote d’Ivoire – are expected in the country within the week to jointly chair a meeting of Ivorian government, rebel and opposition leaders in the capital Yamoussoukro. The two heads of state are expected to thrash out a consensus so that a new prime minister can be named before the 30 October deadline."
UN extends sanctions to diamonds,"The UN Security Council has unanimously approved a new resolution to ban imports of rough diamonds from war-torn Cote d’Ivoire and renew an existing arms embargo. Individual sanctions, repeatedly threatened by the UN, have not yet been implemented. Instead, the 15-member body reiterated its willingness to impose travel bans and asset freezes on individuals deemed to have impeded the peace process, committed human rights violations, publicly incited hatred and violence, or violated the arms embargo. The Security Council on Thursday “renewed for another year the arms embargo and the travel and financial restrictions imposed on the country on 15 November 2004 and decided to ban imports of rough diamonds from the country,” read the resolution. Cote d’Ivoire is bogged down by a three-year old conflict that sliced the country in two when rebels seized the north in a failed coup in September 2002 and the government retained the south after the intervention of troops from former colonial power France. The new ban on Ivorian diamonds follows a report by a UN team of experts who travelled to Cote d’Ivoire to assess whether the warring parties had adhered to the November 2004 arms embargo. The experts reported to the Security Council at the end of last month that rebels were selling rough diamonds to fund military spending. The team also reported that cocoa earnings were being used to fund military spending in government territories. “Cocoa plays an important role in providing funds for the off-budget and extrabudgetary military procurement efforts of the Government,” the report stated. Cote d’Ivoire is the world’s largest cocoa producing nation, producing some 40 percent of the world crop. Cocoa was the driving force of the Ivorian economy in the boom years that followed independence in 1960. But recent conflict has shattered the Cote d’Ivoire’s image as a haven of stability and three years of international negotiations and mediations have failed to resolve the standoff between the rebel and loyalist camps. Newly appointed Prime Minister Charles Konan Banny, who was levered into position just over a week ago after weeks of pan-African pressure to shepherd the country to peace, is still to name his cabinet. The new prime minister takes over a deadlocked peace process and will have to organise a long delayed programme of disarmament, resolve the sensitive issue of who is entitled to citizenship, and organise presidential elections -- all before an October 2006 deadline. An attempt to hold elections last 30 October failed due to a deadlock in talks between the factions on all these issues, forcing the UN to extend President Laurent Gbagbo’s mandate for 12 months by special resolution."
Sanctions imposed but political stalemate strong as ever,"The United Nations may have slapped an embargo on Cote d'Ivoire, but with both government and rebels digging in their heels over key issues that have deadlocked the political process for months, analysts and diplomats doubt the sanctions will prompt a fast return to the negotiating table. President Laurent Gbagbo is adamant the rebels must disarm to break the political stalemate in Cote d’Ivoire. The New Forces rebels and other opposition leaders maintain that Gbagbo must go before peace talks can take place. And both sides are trying to use this week's UN sanctions as ammunition for their arguments. The UN Security Council voted unanimously on Monday to impose a 13-month weapons ban on the divided West African nation and warned that certain individuals would be blocked from travelling abroad and their overseas accounts frozen next month if steps were not taken to get the shattered peace process back on track. Having broken a shaky 18-month ceasefire earlier this month by bombing rebel strongholds, Gbagbo said on Tuesday he was committed to reunifying his country, which has been split into a government-run south and a rebel-held north for more than two years after a failed coup attempt against him. ""The President takes note of the resolution and assures the United Nations, member states and friends of Cote d'Ivoire that he will do nothing to hinder the peace process,"" Gbagbo's spokesman said in a statement read on state television on Tuesday. ""He invites the UN to apply this resolution with the same rigour to the rebels and to immediately begin the disarmament process included in the Marcoussis peace deal."" The UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (ONUCI), which has some 6,000 peacekeepers on the ground, has repeatedly said that its mission is not to disarm the rebels, but to support the transitional government in moving the country to peace and elections planned for October 2005. But some diplomats suggested a change of approach was needed. ""We should now work on an hypothesis along the lines of Sierra Leone, where ONUCI will be charged with carrying out disarmament, by force if necessary,"" one Western diplomat in Abidjan told IRIN, noting that the ONUCI number two was Alan Doss, the man who managed the disarmament process in Sierra Leone after a decade-long civil war there. The rebels had been due to hand over their weapons a month ago but they flatly refused, saying the government had not passed the political reforms that were supposed to precede disarmament. Hurdles to disarmament Guillaume Soro, leader of the New Forces, on Tuesday applauded the UN resolution but warned disarmament was still some way off. ""We welcome the immediate arms embargo which we have been calling for since the Marcoussis peace deal of 2003,"" Soro told IRIN by telephone. ""But the political process can only start up again once Gbagbo is no longer in power."" "
"South Africa says continuing mediation, cautious on sanctions","South Africa denied on Wednesday that it was concluding its mediation in the Cote d'Ivoire crisis as it warned the UN Security Council to take care that any sanctions action did not negatively affect the peace process. ""The South African Mediation stated that it will continue its efforts... to ensure the holding of free, fair and transparent elections in Cote d'Ivoire as scheduled, which is the only solution to the crisis,"" the Security Council said in a statement after a closed-door briefing in New York. Elections on 30 October are at the heart of the international community's blueprint for peace in Cote d'Ivoire but progress towards that goal has been slow. South African mediators have already said that rebels and opposition parties are to blame for the impasse and warned that the world's top cocoa grower could explode into another cycle of violence. Diplomats and UN officials have been warning that individual sanctions, already approved by the Security Council, could now be enforced against spoilers of the peace process. During his briefing, South Africa Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota told the 15-member body it should only act on sanctions ""in a manner that does not negatively affect the peace process."" ""We are not keen to punish people, we are keen to solve the situation and we need to get the elections in place so that people can decide on who runs the country,"" Lekota told reporters afterwards. ""If we find that we have sanctions in place, then we would see this as a failure."" Pierre Schori, the head of the UN mission in Cote d'Ivoire (ONUCI) told reporters that travel bans and asset freezes remained a definite option but suggested more verification would be done before any decision was reached. ""It's very much on the table,"" he said. ""It's important that the sanctions committee come down to Abidjan and report back to the Security Council."" South Africa has been mediating for the last 10 months, at the request of the African Union, to try to bring peace to the West African nation that has been split into a government-run south and a rebel-held north for the last three years. On Tuesday, South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad told a press briefing in Pretoria that the mediation had ended and it was now up to the UN to decide whether elections could go ahead as scheduled . But on Wednesday the Foreign Ministry clarified that the mediation was continuing. ""What South Africa has concluded is not the mediation itself but a report on the current phase of the mediation,"" spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told IRIN by telephone. With just under two months to go before the planned ballot, UN officials are starting to play down the significance of dates. ""I'm not interested in dates. We are more interested in steps to get to the elections,"" Schori told reporters in New York. And on that front, there remains much work to be done. A voter register has not been drawn up, the National Electoral Commission supposed to supervise the elections has not got off the ground and deadlines in the disarmament process have fallen by the wayside. Meanwhile the security situation remains tense. ""It makes grim reading,"" Schori said. ""There is an absence of the rule of law and ongoing harassments."" Underscoring that, ONUCI officials in Abidjan said that a peacekeeper had died in the main rebel city, Bouake, on Wednesday ""from blows and wounds inflicted by as yet unidentified assailants"". The 35-year-old Moroccan peacekeeper was found stabbed to death shortly after midnight near the police training school, UN military spokesman Renald Boismoreau said. ONUCI, whose 6,000 peacekeepers man the buffer zone with some 4,000 French troops, said it had opened an investigation into the killing."
"UN scolds Ivorian leaders, brandishes threat of sanctions","With mediation efforts to end Cote d’Ivoire’s three-year war floundering yet again, the United Nations wagged a finger at leaders on both sides of the divide and brandished the threat of sanctions. The uncertainty surrounding the mediation by South African President Thabo Mbeki is fuelling tension on the ground. At the same time it is highlighting rifts among African nations involved in trying to bring peace to the country that was once a regional haven of peace and prosperity. Upping the stakes in the drive for peace, the 15-nation UN Security Council is sending one of its members, Greek Ambassador Adamantios Vassilakis, to decide whether to impose sanctions on Ivorian leaders deemed to be blocking the peace process. Vassilakis, who is head of the council’s sanctions committee, is scheduled to visit in mid-October, just days before peace-sealing elections are supposed to be held on 30 October. Cote d’Ivoire has been split in two since September 2002 between a rebel-held north and government-controlled south, with around 10,000 UN and French peacekeepers patrolling the buffer zone. After an upsurge in violence last November, the UN Security Council approved individual sanctions such as travel bans and asset freezes against Ivorian leaders found to be blocking peace efforts. But the sanctions have not yet been brought into effect. In a statement late Wednesday, the UN said the ambassador’s visit had been arranged “so that the Council will be in a position to take appropriate action in response to those who pose a threat to the peace and national reconciliation process … or who are determined to be responsible for serious violations of human rights.” According to Pierre Schori, the head of the UN mission in Cote d'Ivoire, all sides are guilty of failing to fully commit to peace. “Every actor still has a role to play. Nobody has done everything (in their power),” he told a press conference on Thursday. ""There’s no role for people who say ‘There’s nothing I can do’. There’s work to be done, just look at the (peace) agreements.” Under an April peace deal mediated by Mbeki, which is just the latest in a string of draft accords, Cote d’Ivoire was to have disarmed by beginning of October so that presidential elections could be held in a reunified country on 30 October. But even UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has acknowledged that the poll is ""not going to be possible"", so the crunch election is now almost certainly going to be postponed, stoking fears that the country could slide into chaos. “No time to lose” says UN Schori said rebels must show goodwill by preparing to gather in cantonment sites ahead of an eventual disarmament while President Laurent Gbagbo ensures that pro-government militia hand in their weapons and an independent election committee begins its work. “Some very good things have been achieved, but we must continue,"" he said. ""There is no time to lose.” Meanwhile the two sides are rowing about who should lead future international mediation efforts. Mbeki has fallen out of favour with the rebels after one of his ministers recently chided them while patting Gbagbo on the back for his peace efforts. The rebels have banned South African mediators from the north and have been urging the AU and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to officially declare his mission as mediator over. “Mbeki does not understand this crisis at all,” rebel leader Guillaume Soro told IRIN in an interview this weekend in the rebel headquarters of Bouake. AU and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, whose country vies with South Africa as the voice of the continent, last weekend appeared to lean in the rebels' favour when he pledged “renewed efforts by Nigeria, ECOWAS and the AU to find new ways of solving the crisis."" But media reports that the AU had halted Mbeki’s mission as peacemaker were angrily denied by the South African president’s office as untrue and ""nothing but fabrications"". Gbagbo in the meantime has reiterated his refusal to join any other peace effort but Mbeki’s. He is also refusing to attend an ECOWAS summit that has not yet been officially announced, saying the regional bloc had tried but failed in the past to draw a line under the Ivorian war and that some members had already shown themselves to be in the rebel camp. “I will not take this business back to ECOWAS. That’s over, we need to move ahead,” he said on Wednesday evening. “When you walk you put one foot forward, then another, you don’t take a step back.” Gbagbo said this week that he had written to the UN suggesting all parties join a parley in the Ivorian capital Yamoussoukro that would be chaired by Mbeki. In Addis Ababa, an official said the AU was planning to bring the continent's heads of state together for a summit on Cote d’Ivoire before 30 October. Should the poll not take place as scheduled, Gbagbo has said he will stay on as president until fresh elections are held. However, his political rivals and the rebels claim he does not have a mandate beyond 30 October and have called on him to stand down and give way to a transitional authority."
Will the UN Security Council impose a second wave of sanctions?,"Wednesday is the day the United Nations Security Council threatened to impose a second wave of sanctions on anyone obstructing Cote d'Ivoire's peace process. But will the travel bans and asset freezes be forthcoming? Algerian ambassador Abdallah Baali, the Security Council president for December, seemed to hint on Monday that the UN might wait and give a recent peace drive by South African President Thabo Mbeki time to bear fruit. ""We have decided to give President Mbeki's facilitation efforts a chance to be completed before doing anything else,"" he was quoted as saying by several news agencies following a closed-door meeting of the 15-nation council. After Ivorian troops shattered an 18-month ceasefire at the beginning of November, the UN slapped a year-long arms embargo on the West African nation. It also warned that further measures would swing into action against certain individuals on 15 December unless progress was made to solve the conflict. Civil war in Cote d'Ivoire erupted in September 2002 when rebels launched an insurgency, splitting the country into a government-run south and a rebel-held north. Mbeki was sent in as a peacemaker by the African Union, and last week after a five-day visit, he wrangled promises out of all parties to revive a French-brokered peace agreement from 2003, known as Linas-Marcoussis. He said Cote d'Ivoire's government, opposition and the New Forces rebels had agreed that political reforms should be passed, disarmament should begin, the government of national reconciliation should return to work and security should be restored to the West African nation. Although similar pledges have been made at a myriad of previous summits, analysts say that the UN is unlikely to weigh in with further penalties just yet, especially given the fact that the AU's own Peace and Security Council has postponed its meeting on Cote d'Ivoire's troubles by a month to 10 January. ""I think that it's reasonable not to expect the UN Security Council to take any monumental decision that would undermine Mbeki's mediation,"" explained Mike McGovern, the West Africa project director for the influential think tank, the International Crisis Group. ""The fact that the AU has put off its meeting until January means there's going to be a lot of pressure on the UN to hold fire,"" McGovern added. The UN has also not yet appointed a new Special Representative for Cote d'Ivoire following the resignation of Albert Tevoedjre. But one western diplomat, who attended Mbeki’s mediation as a representative of the European Union, did not rule out additional sanctions this week. ""We actually do expect a vote for additional sanctions because the Security Council does not have the impression that the [peace process] is advancing,"" he told IRIN by phone. ""We believe that there has to be pressure exerted on all parties in Ivory Coast. There is no point in endless talks if there is no political goodwill.” The UN Security Council is expected to issue a statement formally announcing its decision on Wednesday or Thursday. Marches banned, reforms sent to parliament Since Mbeki's much-vaunted mediation, there have been some small signs of progress. Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo has banned public marches for three months. The ban was imposed last week just before some of his more militant supporters, the Young Patriots, were due to take to the streets to demand that former colonial power France withdraw its 5,000 peacekeeping troops. "
Preparations for war reported despite UN sanctions threat,"The threat of sanctions loomed over Cote d’Ivoire on Monday as the United Nations prepared to vote on an arms embargo and other penalties on the West African nation. On the ground, however, Ivorian rebel and government forces were reported to be preparing for war. ""What we are getting is that all sides are trying to get new offensive weapons,"" Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo told reporters on Sunday in Abuja, Nigeria, after four hours of talks on the Ivorian crisis with his counterparts from Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Senegal and Togo. France has been pushing fellow Security Council members to slap a ban on the sale of arms to Cote d’Ivoire and impose travel restrictions on Ivorian officials from 10 December. The French move came after the Ivorian army shattered an 18-month ceasefire and killed nine French peacekeepers in the process. A diplomatic source told IRIN the vote, delayed from last week so African leaders could hold crisis talks, might take place on Monday afternoon. South African President Thabo Mbeki and other government officials held talks with Ivorian opposition leaders in Pretoria late last week, while Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo was to have attended Sunday’s meeting in Abuja, but did not. Instead, he sent the speaker of parliament, and did little to allay the regional leaders’ fears. ""Do you think I am going to leave my country with no air defence?"" he said in an interview on French radio broadcast on Sunday. The African leaders threw their weight behind the draft resolution at the weekend and even went one step further, calling for sanctions to take effect immediately instead of giving Cote d'Ivoire a month's grace period. ""We support the proposed UN resolution, particularly the arms embargo in Cote d'Ivoire. This should be immediate,"" said Obasanjo, who is the current chairman of the African Union. Since rebels attempted to topple Gbagbo in September 2002, Cote d’Ivoire has been split into a government-controlled south and a rebel-held north. In a move widely seen as favouring a military solution, Gbagbo replaced the head of the army, Mathias Doue, with Philippe Mangou, the man who oversaw this month's ceasefire-breaking assault on rebel territory. ""We are just trying to reunify our country,"" Mangou – considered a hardliner by many - told IRIN when the assault kicked off on 4 November. He repeated that line on state television on Sunday after his appointment. Reuters news agency quoted a military source at the weekend as saying Gbagbo had already ordered new fighter jets and helicopter gunships and some had arrived in nearby states. Virtually all of Cote d'Ivoire's airforce was destroyed on 6 November by French forces in retaliation for a bombing on one of their bases, in which the nine French peacekeepers were killed. On Monday there were fears of fresh attacks, given that electricity and water to supplies to the north have been cut, as they were before the first government offensive. Military and diplomatic sources, humanitarian workers and residents all said the supplies – which had been restored earlier in the week - were cut again on Sunday afternoon, as African leaders were meeting in Abuja. ""The alarm is that that used to be the prelude to an imminent attack,"" Obasanjo said. ""Both parties should not start anything that will amount to a retaliatory attack. We call on everybody to observe the ceasefire."" Civilians in the north are preparing to march on Wednesday from the main rebel-held city of Bouake, across the buffer zone, to Abidjan, some 400 km away, to demand Gbagbo’s resignation. ""Given that the civilian population has been targeted and hurt, we have to take our destiny in our own hands,"" Abel Dgohore Gbakayoro, one of the organisers, told IRIN. ""We think we can get 24,000 people out on the street. The buffer zone is for belligerents and we are not armed so it should be fine,"" he said. The streets in Abidjan were quiet on Monday, a public holiday, and the flood of foreigners fleeing the country had slowed to a trickle. A spokesman for the French forces in Cote d'Ivoire said just one evacuation flight was scheduled for Monday, and that there were now only around 50 people taking refuge at the French military base, which at one point had sheltered almost 2,000. An official at the French embassy said the last evacuation flight would probably be on Wednesday. More than 6,000 foreigners, around 85 percent of them French, have fled in the past five days after Ivorians, irate at Paris for wiping out their airforce, went on a rampage, stripping expatriate homes bare and torching businesses and schools. Foreigners were attacked, some with machetes, and women were raped, according to various sources No expatriate deaths were reported, but Gbagbo's spokesman has said 62 Ivorians died and more than 1,300 were injured during demonstrations against and clashes with French troops."
Disarmament talks begin as UN warns of sanctions in case of delay,"The two sides in Cote d’Ivoire’s three-year-old civil war made a fresh bid to set a timetable for disarmament on Thursday as the UN Security Council threatened sanctions in the event of further delays. Rebel and army chiefs came together in the country's official capital for two days of talks to finalise the details of a disarmament timeline agreed by the country’s main political leaders at a peace summit in Pretoria, South Africa, on 29 June. The Pretoria agreement brokered by African Union mediator and South African President Thabo Mbeki demands that the 42,000-strong rebel army start handing in its weapons to UN peacekeepers at special cantonment sites by the end of July. It also insists that pro-government militias operating in the loyalist south begin disarming immediately and complete the process by 20 August. Disarmament must be completed before the world’s top cocoa producer can reunify and hold presidential elections. The polls are planned for 30 October, but diplomats have been warning for months that it will be difficult to organise credible elections in such a short timeframe. The civil war erupted in September 2002 and although a peace deal was agreed in principle four months later, international efforts to shepherd the divided West African nation towards peace have snagged repeatedly on the issue of disarmament. The Pretoria Two accord is only the latest in a string of attempts to put Cote d'Ivoire's flagging peace process back on track. As international patience wears thin, the Security Council on Wednesday urged Ivorian parties to “comply scrupulously with the timetable agreed on 29 June 2005 in Pretoria” and the commitments agreed at an earlier peace summit in the South African capital last April. “The Security Council affirms that it stands ready, in close consultation with the African Union mediation, to implement individual sanctions … against those who do not comply with these commitments to constitute an obstacle to their full implementation.” UN Security Council resolution 1572 of 15 November 2004, authorised a travel ban and asset freeze on individuals identified as blocking the peace process. The United Nations subsequently drew up a confidential list of possible targets for such sanctions, but they have not so far been applied. Officials attending the talks in Yamoussoukro said the military chiefs, flanked by members of the UN Mission in Cote d’Ivoire (ONUCI), were not only discussing a timetable for disarmament. They were also discussing ways of tightening security in the main southern city of Abidjan for rebel members of the country’s government of national reconciliation. Rebel ministers have failed to turn up at cabinet meetings in Abidjan since last October, saying they feared for their safety. Opposition politicians and members of the New Forces rebel movement hold half of the portfolios in the government chaired by independent Prime Minister Seydou Diarra. The rebels failed to respect earlier deadlines established for starting disarmament because of delays in implementing agreed political reforms to give the four million immigrants from other West African countries and their offspring, greater rights to own land and take out Ivorian nationality. Immigrants from neighbouring countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea make up a quarter of Cote d'Ivoire's 16 million population. The 29 June Pretoria declaration stated specifically that disarmament and political reform must go hand in hand. ""It was agreed that the intake of combatants should start as from the end of July 2005, recognising the linkage with the decision to amend the Nationality and Identity laws,"" the document said. It gave parliament until 15 July to adopt seven laws proposed by the South African mediation team, but with only a week to go until this deadline runs out, no new bills have yet been submitted to the legislature. These seven laws demanded by the Pretoria declaration relate to the reform of the Independent Electoral Commission, the financing of political parties, the right to Ivorian nationality, the issue of national identity documents, the establishment of a human rights commission and the regulation of newspapers, radio and television."
Former president calls for Gbagbo to hand over to a transitional government,"Opposition leader and former president Henri Konan Bedie, fresh back in wartorn Cote d'Ivoire after a year in self-imposed exile in Paris, has called on President Laurent Gbagbo to hand over power to a transitional government if, as expected, planned elections do not take place on 30 October. Speaking on Sunday night, and flanked by bodyguards as well as UN peacekeeping troops, the 71-year old presidential candidate for the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI), one of the country's two main opposition parties, told reporters that Gbagbo should not remain in power after his mandate expires at the end of October. ""When one has spent five years governing and when one has not been able to organise democratic elections, how can one demand [the mandate] to be prolonged?"" Bedie said. Gbagbo has said since April that should elections not take place for any reason, he will remain in his post. Under peace deals signed since January 2003, presidential elections were to have been held on 30 October - the end of the incumbent's five-year term. But foot-dragging in preparation for the polls from all sides in Cote d'Ivoire's three-year civil conflict, means the ballot cannot take place as planned according to UN chief Kofi Annan. In interviews to French media organisations over the weekend, Annan blamed political leaders from both sides of the divide for the delays and accused them of ""destroying"" Cote d'Ivoire where 10,000 French and UN troops have been keeping a sometimes shaky peace. ""I do not understand these Ivorian leaders, these men who believe they are capable of leading a country, who are seeking to become president of a country they are in the process of destroying,"" said Annan in an interview with Radio France Internationale. Services and infrastructure are visibly crumbling in northern Cote d'Ivoire, which has been controlled by rebel forces and cut off from government funds, for a full three years. The UN Security Council will review possible sanctions on Ivorian political leaders, Annan said. ""The matter [of sanctions] has been referred to the Security Council. The issue of sanctions has not been ruled out.... I think that sooner or later the Council will have to act in this direction,"" he said. Bedie, who was met at the airport by Prime Minister Seydou Diarra and a jubilant crowd of PDCI supporters on Sunday, said he would back UN sanctions. ""We have always wanted sanctions after what has happened in Cote d'Ivoire,"" he said, listing a number of charges against Gbagbo, including the killing of at least 120 civilians in March last year by security forces attempting to quash an opposition demonstration. ""First, there were very serious human rights violations, with deaths, exactions, kidnappings and the events of 26 March 2004,"" Bedie said. ""The UN mission in Cote d'Ivoire has investigated all this. All that is left is to impose sanctions."" Bedie ruled Cote d'Ivoire from 1993, until he was deposed in the country's first and only successful coup d'etat in 1999 destroying the country's image as a bastion of stability in a troubled region."
"UN holds back on sanctions, giving Mbeki extra time","A deadline for United Nations sanctions against Cote d’Ivoire came and went this week with no punitive action bar a sharp warning from the Security Council, which is giving South African President Thabo Mbeki extra time to mediate peace. As the midnight 15 December deadline passed, a statement from the Security Council “deplored the fact that the parties have not implemented all their commitments”, and warned that a special UN committee was busy listing those Ivorian leaders who will face a travel ban and assets freeze if quick progress is not made to end the two-year conflict. The statement set no new time for compliance, but Algerian ambassador Abdallah Baali, the Security Council president for December, has indicated that the UN preference would be to give more time to the African Union’s peace bid, led by Mbeki. ""We have decided to give President Mbeki's facilitation efforts a chance to be completed before doing anything else,"" he said in New York this week. Analysts have said the UN is unlikely to take any action that would undermine Mbeki’s mediation until after January 10 when the AU’s own Peace and Security Council meets to discuss Cote d’Ivoire’s troubles. In a first sign that Mbeki’s mediation was bearing fruit, documents obtained by IRIN showed that the peace process was largely on track at the moment, with key legislative reforms adopted in Abidjan on Friday, two weeks before a deadline set by the South African mediator. The brewing crisis in the world’s top cocoa producer, already split in two between a rebel-held north and loyalist south, spiralled out of control in early November when government forces shattered an 18-month cease-fire by bombing rebel positions. Mbeki went in as the African Union’s peacemaker, and last week after a five-day visit he wrangled promises out of all parties to revive a French-brokered peace agreement from 2003, known as Linas-Marcoussis, setting deadlines for each stage. He said Cote d'Ivoire's government, opposition and the New Forces rebels had agreed that political reforms should be passed, disarmament should begin, the government of national reconciliation should return to work and security should be restored to the West African nation. Mbeki insists on ""speedy progress"" In the South African capital, Pretoria, on Friday, Mbeki met rebel leaders from the New Forces who claimed to be carrying new proposals to break a deadlock. “We agreed on everything,” Mbeki said after the talks, adding that he aimed to reinforce his team in Cote d’Ivoire by sending special envoys to both Abidjan and to the central rebel-held town of Bouake. “Speedy progress must be made.” Meanwhile in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire's largest city, the loyalist-dominated parliament adopted legislation that may go some way to defusing ethnic tension in the country. With the current parliamentary session due to close on Friday ahead of the holiday break, members were voting on legislation that would enable the naturalization of 700,000 foreigners. Nationality is a volatile issue in Cote d’Ivoire where around a quarter of the 16.8 million people have foreign roots. Migrants largely from neighbouring countries who came attracted by the nation’s prosperity and former stability have faced growing hostility over the past decade due to the promotion of a notion of being purely Ivorian. That notion not only barred long-time migrants from owning land but in 2000 was enshrined in the constitution under Article 35, which states that presidential candidates must have two Ivorian parents. Parliament on Friday also adopted legislation to scrap the controversial clause. Under Mbeki’s deadlines for peace, the government has two months to amend the constitution. The reform is needed if opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, who draws most of his support from the rebel-held north and was barred from running against Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo in the 2000 elections, is to participate in polls scheduled for October 2005. But Gbagbo often has insisted a referendum is necessary. Since Mbeki launched his mediation, there have been some other small signs of progress. Gbagbo last week banned public marches for three months, just days before some of his more militant supporters, the Young Patriots, were to take to the streets to demand that former colonial power France pull out its 5,000 peacekeeping troops."
Authorities target alleged mercenaries,"South Africa is getting tough with former members of its armed forces and citizens involved in mercenary activities outside its borders. On Tuesday South Africa's elite Scorpions unit arrested a former defence force pilot for alleged mercenary activities in the troubled west African country of Cote d'Ivoire. Carl Frederick Alberts, 49, appeared in court on Wednesday and was charged with contravening the Foreign Military Assistance Act. He was granted bail of R5,000 (about US $725) and is to appear in court again on 13 February. Scorpions spokesman Sipho Ngwema told IRIN that the unit was ""still investigating [mercenary activities in] the whole of the [African] continent, and we expect to make several arrests"". Alberts is only the second person to be arrested and prosecuted for alleged contraventions of the Foreign Military Assistance Act. In July last year a naturalised South African citizen and former French military officer, Richard Rouget, was arrested for recruiting mercenaries to fight in the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire. Ngwema said Rouget, 43, was convicted ""in August last year and was sentenced to five years in prison or R100,000 [about US $14,500] fine. He paid the fine"". The Scorpions are ""looking into whether there are any contraventions [of the Foreign Military Assistance Act] in Iraq"", Ngwema added. The government's National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC), which has oversight regarding matters such as mercenary activities, expressed condolences to the family of a South African killed in a bomb blast in Baghdad on 28 January. The deceased was reportedly employed by a security company operating in Iraq. NCACC chairman and cabinet minister, Kader Asmal, noted in a statement that ""the government has become aware that South African citizens and South African companies may be rendering security and related services in Iraq"". This could be in contravention of the Foreign Military Assistance Act, which prohibits South African citizens, people granted permanent residence in the country, or a ""person registered or incorporated in the Republic, and any foreign citizen within the borders of the Republic from rendering foreign military assistance without authorisation from the National Conventional Arms Control Committee"". The NCACC has designated Iraq as a ""theatre of armed conflict"", which means the Foreign Military Assistance Act is applicable. Thus, any contravention in Iraq of the ""obligations contained in the Act, (which cover the provision of related services other than military assistance), will be referred to the Directorate of Public Prosecutions [the departmental home of the Scorpions] for further investigation and prosecution,"" the NCACC warned. Ngwema said he could not ""say at this stage whether we have received any indication of contraventions of the Act in Iraq"". Military analyst Henri Boshoff, of the Institute for Security Studies, told IRIN reports that up to 1,500 South Africans could be operating in Iraq were ""speculation - 1,500 is a lot of people and I'm sure [South African] customs would have picked it up"". He said the South African killed in Baghdad was working for a company called Erinys International, which has reportedly been contracted by the coalition forces to provide security at oil fields in Iraq. On its website Erinys describes itself as ""an international business intelligence and security risk consultancy focused on Africa and the Middle East"", adding that it has ""an established in-country capability, under expatriate (UK) management, to provide security services within Iraq"". The company lists main offices in Johannesburg and Dubai. In Iraq, the company said that ""in addition to security audits and assessments, security planning and executive protection, we are currently the sole providers of: guarding and protective services; secure warehousing; security escorts; visit logistics and protective escorts; and transportation and logistics for land access from neighbouring countries"". THIN LINE ""If you are looking at security, guarding ... and close protection, you have to ask is it military assistance [in a designated theatre of conflict]? It's a very thin line these guys are walking,"" Boshoff said. He added that, given the arrest of Alberts, it was likely that the Scorpions were currently ""working on the Ivory Coast loop - I think that's their focus at this stage, [not Iraq]. That was the last group [of mercenaries] that were known to have gone out, and I think it was between 10 and 20 guys - not bigger than that"". While there had been speculation that up to 40 South Africans could be involved in the strife in Cote d'Ivoire, the two arrests so far of ""the chopper pilot and the other guy who was a consultant, means it does not look like it was foot-soldiers, but more support staff - but it's still contravening [military assistance regulations of] the Act"", Boshoff explained. He noted, though, that future investigations may well focus on other conflict zones in Africa such as Sudan, Ethiopia-Eritrea, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi. ""There's still ongoing conflict in Sudan, and then although there's peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea, it is still a volatile situation there, and then the DRC-Burundi is still volatile. Everywhere where there's conflict they will have to look at it,"" including Iraq, Boshoff said."
South Africa ends mediation blaming rebels and opposition,"Blaming rebels and opposition parties, South Africa said on Tuesday it was ending its mediation in the Cote d'Ivoire crisis and it was now the UN's call whether elections aimed at restoring peace to the West African nation could be held on schedule on 30 October. ""We have fulfilled our obligations and now it is up to the African Union and the United Nations,"" Lesoana Makhanda, an Abidjan-based member of the mediation team, told IRIN. The African Union mandated South Africa to help end the standoff in Cote d'Ivoire after a flare-up in violence last November. The country has been split into a government-run south and a rebel-held north for the last three years, with some 10,000 UN and French peacekeepers in between. Fresh elections are at the heart of the international community's blueprint for peace, but progress towards that goal has been slow. With exactly two months to go before the planned ballot, a voter register has not been drawn up, the National Electoral Commission supposed to supervise the elections has not got off the ground and deadlines in the disarmament process have fallen by the wayside. Briefing reporters in Pretoria on Tuesday, South Africa's Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad blamed Cote d'Ivoire's political opposition and the rebels for the deadlock. ""If they don't find a solution the situation will only deteriorate and we believe Cote d'Ivoire will explode into another cycle of violence and tragedy,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. ""There is no reason left for the... opposition forces not to enter the processes and fight the democratic elections to ensure that for the first time Cote d'Ivoire can have a government that can then deal with the problems the country is facing,"" he said. Last week the New Forces rebels said that elections would not be allowed go ahead on their territory, because conditions were not right for free and fair polls to be held. The rebels and the main Ivorian opposition parties are demanding that President Laurent Gbagbo step down so an interim government can organise the poll at a later date. ““(We) demand a transitional body be put in place,"" Alphonse Djedje-Mady, the spokesman for an alliance of four opposition parties, told a press conference on Monday. ""It is evident that it will be materially and technically impossible to organise presidential elections in October 2005."" There has been no immediate reaction from Gbagbo's camp, but the president has maintained since the beginning of the year that if elections are delayed he will stay on until a new head of state has been elected. Will polls go ahead as scheduled? The UN has been sticking fast to the 30 October timeframe, but over the weekend, Antonio Monteiro, the UN envoy charged with overseeing Cote d'Ivoire's polls, suggested that having the right conditions in place took priority over the date. “The election date is less important. What matters is to create an environment conducive to fair, free, and democratic elections that can be accepted by all the parties,” Monteiro told Radio France Internationale. Most diplomats in Cote d'Ivoire's de facto capital, Abidjan, have been saying privately for weeks that holding a credible poll at the end of October will be impossible.

Attention will now turn to the UN Security Council, which is set to receive what will be the final briefing from the South African mediation team on Wednesday. ""It is implicit in the Security Council resolution that the Security Council will take action, sanctions, against anyone who is obstructing implementation of Linas-Marcoussis agreements,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Pahad said on Tuesday. Individual sanctions, such as travel bans and asset freezes, have already been approved by the Security Council who held off imposing them to give the South African mediation time. Diplomats say the sanctions could now be enforced not only against those blocking the peace process but also against those committing human rights abuses, inciting people to hate and breaking an arms embargo. ""The threat of sanctions has been out there so long, and given the fact we are not going to meet the October elections deadline, I think it's time to apply them,"" one diplomat in Abidjan told IRIN on Tuesday. ""I think the rebels have perhaps been more obvious in terms of their unwillingness to move forward."" Rebel spokesman Sidiki Konate told IRIN that leader Guillaume Soro had sent a letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan explaining why October polls weren't an option and shrugged off talk of sanctions. ""The New Forces did not do anything against the peace process, we are partners of the peace process, so I don't know why we would be served sanctions,"" Konate said by telephone. Another Western diplomat cautioned that bringing sanctions into effect could make the warring factions even more intransigent. ""It could make them feel like they were pushed into a corner by the international community,"" the diplomat said. ""There could be serious repercussions and I am not sure if the UN is willing to take that risk."""
Pretoria summit agrees to kick-start disarmament,"The main political factions in Cote d'Ivoire agreed on Wednesday to kick-start a much-delayed process of disarmament and reaffirmed a commitment to hold presidential elections on 30 October. The decisions were announced in a joint statement following two days of talks in Pretoria chaired by South African President Thabo Mbeki in his role as African Union mediator in the three-year-old Ivorian conflict. The statement, signed by President Laurent Gbagbo, rebel leader Guillaume Soro and the leaders of the two main parliamentary opposition parties, said the disarmament of pro-Gbagbo militia forces in the government-controlled south of the country, would begin immediately and end by 20 August. Although a ceremony was held in the western town of Guiglo on 25 May to mark the start of disarmament by these shadowy militia groups, the declaration noted that ""the actual disarmament and dismantling of the militia has not yet commenced."" The rebels were refusing to hand in their weapons until the militias began disarming. The statement said government and rebel military chiefs would meet again on 7 July to finalise a timetable for disarming the 42,000 rebel fighters who control the north of Cote d'Ivoire. These would start handing in their weapons to UN peacekeepers at special cantonment sites by the end of July, it added. Rebel ministers would meanwhile return to full participation in Cote d'Ivoire's broad-based government of national reconciliation immediately. Mbeki described the agreement to breathe new life into the flagging peace process as an ""historical occasion."" ""The agreement reflects the determination of all the leaders present here,"" he stressed. The declaration recognised that the rebels had failed to respect earlier deadlines established for starting disarmament because of delays in implementing agreed political reforms. It stated specifically that these two processes had to go hand in hand. ""It was agreed that the intake of combatants should start as from the end of July 2005, recognising the linkage with the decision to amend the Nationality and Identity laws,"" the document said. It set a deadline of 15 July for parliament in Abidjan to adopt seven laws proposed by the South African mediation team. These relate to the reform of the Independent Electoral Commission, the financing of political parties, the right to Ivorian nationality, the issue of national identity documents, and the establishment of a human rights commission and the regulation of newspapers, radio and television. Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) party has so far delayed the passage of several of these laws through parliament. The statement said that if the legislature failed to pass them within the next two weeks, Mbeki, in his capacity as mediator, would be authorised to instruct Gbagbo to ensure the passage of the necessary legal amendments by issuing special decrees and orders. Although diplomats have increasingly questioned the feasibility of reuniting the West African country and organising credible presidential elections in just four months, all those present at the Pretoria summit reiterated that the ballot should take place on schedule. ""They reaffirmed the importance of moving speedily with the removal of all obstacles to the holding of presidential elections in October 2005,"" it said. In preparation of the elections, Gbagbo has angered the rebels and their allies in the parliamentary opposition parties by putting the National Statistics Institute in charge of drawing up a new electoral register, rather than the Independent Electoral Commission. The Pretoria summit confirmed that the statistics institute, which is controlled by the government, would continue to handle this process. But the meeting specified that it would only do so under the direct control of the electoral commission, where the opposition parties and rebels will also be represented. The meeting in the South African capital has been dubbed ""Pretoria Two"" by the Ivorian media. It was called by Mbeki to speed up progress towards disarmament, national reunification and elections, following delays in the implementation of several key measures agreed at a first summit in Pretoria that ended on 6 April. Besides Gbagbo and Soro, the summit was attended by Prime Minister Seydou Diarra, former president Henri Konan Bedie, the leader of the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI), the largest opposition party in parliament, and former prime minister Alassane Ouattara, the leader of the Rally of the Republicans (RDR) opposition party, which commands strong support in the rebel-held north. Ouattara, who intends to challenge Gbagbo in the presidential election, said holding the ballot in October would be ""tight, but possible."" ""I do think this time implementation should not be a problem,"" he told reporters. ""I think we will move forward again. We have all agreed to the imposition of sanctions, which shows we are committed to the peace process."" The Pretoria Two communique ended by recommending that the African Union and the UN Security Council ""impose appropriate sanctions against those parties who fail to implement the Pretoria agreements and block the peace process."" UN Security Council resolution 1572 of 15 November 2004, authorised the Secretary General to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on key individuals identified as blocking the peace process. The United Nations subsequently drew up a confidential list of possible targets for such sanctions, but they have not so far been applied."
UN threatens action after finding 22 military vehicles at port (corrected),"UN officials monitoring an arms embargo against Cote d’Ivoire said on Thursday that they had found 22 military vehicles at Abidjan port, the first potential violation of the restrictions that were slapped on the divided West African nation seven months ago. ""It's the first concrete case we've found and there will be consequences,” Pierre Schori, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative in Cote d’Ivoire, said at a weekly media briefing. UN peacekeepers checking cargo at the fruit terminal in the country’s main city of Abidjan had come across 22 grey military vehicles as well as crates, according to a military spokesman for the UN mission in Cote d’Ivoire (ONUCI). In a statement, the Ivorian army said the shipment consisted of 22 jeeps delivered to the Defence Ministry by an Abidjan arms dealer at the request of the government. The jeeps were a replacement shipment for an order of munitions that had been made and paid for before the UN arms embargo came into effect, the army said. The UN Security Council banned the supply of arms and military hardware to Cote d’Ivoire on 15 November, days after Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo sent warplanes on bombing raids against rebel forces, violating a ceasefire accord and killing French peacekeepers in the process. Schori said on Thursday that details of the possible violation had been sent to the UN sanctions committee in New York. Cote d'Ivoire, the world’s top cocoa producer, has been divided in two since a failed rebel coup in September 2002. Rebel forces control the north while troops loyal to Gbagbo hold the south, including the port city of Abidjan. The main political factions in Cote d'Ivoire agreed at a summit in Pretoria on Wednesday to move ahead with a faltering peace process by setting new deadlines for disarmament. Gbagbo, along with rebel leader Guillaume Soro and the leaders of the two main parliamentary opposition parties, agreed that the disarmament of the pro-government militias would start immediately and be completed by 20 August. The 42,000 rebel fighters who control the north of Cote d'Ivoire would start handing in their weapons to UN peacekeepers at special cantonment sites by the end of July. Government and rebel military chiefs are due to meet on 7 July to finalise the timetable. Disarmament must take place to allow the holding of elections on October 30 as agreed in previous peace deals between the two sides. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the conclusions of the summit and urged the parties to stick strictly to the new dates. ""The time has come to move on this path briskly,"" said a statement issued by his office on Thursday. ""The Secretary-General also notes that the declaration envisages the imposition of sanctions against those parties who fail to implement the Pretoria Agreement."" The Security Council's November resolution threatened travel bans and asset freezes for anyone found to be blocking the peace process."
Mbeki reports on peace mission as opposition accuses Gbagbo of preparing for war,"President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa briefed African leaders on Monday on his efforts to prevent Cote d'Ivoire relapsing into full-scale civil war as opposition leaders in the country accused President Laurent Gbagbo of preparing to resume hostilities. The crisis in Cote d'Ivoire was discussed behind closed doors at the start of a two-day summit of the African Union's 15-nation Peace and Security Council in the Gabonese capital Libreville. But events outside the conference room indicated that Mbeki had made little progress in putting a 2003 peace agreement between Gbagbo and rebels occupying the north of Cote d'Ivoire back on the rails. The G7 alliance, which groups Cote d'Ivoire's rebel movement and the main opposition parties in parliament, issued a blunt statement on Monday accusing Gbagbo of continuing to seek a military solution to the two-and-a-half-year-old conflict and urging the United Nations to impose further sanctions on the country. ""The head of state is sticking to the military option as the only way out of the crisis and is preparing for an imminent resumption of hostilities,"" the G7 said in a statement that was published by several Abidjan newspapers. ""As a result, the G7 political forces ask the UN Security Council to apply effectively and immediately the sanctions provided for in resolution 1572,"" it added. This Security Council resolution imposed an immediate arms embargo on Cote d'Ivoire following an abortive attempt by Gbagbo to invade the rebel-held north of the country in early November. It also threatened to slap a travel ban and asset freeze on key individuals seen as obstructing the peace process in a second wave of sanctions. Gbagbo, who had earlier declined an invitation to attend the Libreville summit, turned up unexpectedly in the Gabonese capital on Monday morning. So too did a delegation from the G7 opposition alliance, led by its chairman Alphonse Djedje-Mady, the secretary general of Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI), the largest opposition party in parliament. However, the Libreville summit may not have the final word in setting regional policy on Cote d'Ivoire. Officials of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which played a key role in trying to broker peace in Cote d'Ivoire before Mbeki came on the scene two months ago, said their organisation would hold its annual summit in the Nigerian capital Abuja on 19 January. The situation in Cote d'Ivoire would be a major topic on the summit agenda, they told IRIN by telephone from Abuja. ECOWAS, which groups 15 countries in West Africa, is chaired by Ghanaian President John Kufuor. He hosted an African summit in Accra at the end of July to try and revive the Ivorian peace process. However, ECOWAS has its headquarters in Nigeria, the largest and most powerful state in the region. Mbeki was called in as a mediator in Cote d'Ivoire by the AU after Gbagbo broke an 18-month-old ceasefire on 4 November by launching air raids on the rebel-held north and mustering ground forces for a ground offensive through UN peacekeepers patrolling a buffer zone along the frontline. The military push was stopped in its tracks after just two days when French peacekeepers destroyed the president's small fleet of jet bombers and helicopter gunships on the ground. But this military intervention sparked off anti-French rioting in Abidjan which led to the evacuation of nearly 9,000 European residents in the city, most of whom were French businessmen and their families. The Marcoussis peace agreement provides for the rebels to disarm before the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections in October this year. However, given the long delays in implementing political reforms that were supposed to be put in place before the rebels handed in their weapons and the continuing climate of deep distrust between Gbagbo and the opposition, diplomats have begun to question privately whether the elections can still be held on schedule. Gbagbo himself spoke publicly about a possible postponement last week. The president said he would not step down at the end of his present four-year term if fresh elections could not take place in October. Following its discussion of the situation in Cote d'Ivoire, the AU Peace and Security Council was due to debate the continuing conflict in Sudan's Darfur province and a recent upsurge of violence in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The government in Kinshasa has accused neighbouring Rwanda of staging incursions across the border and backing insurgent forces in eastern DRC. Kigali has denied these claims, but has said it is ready to cross the border to strike at Hutu militia forces based in DRC that threaten its own security. Presidents Joseph Kabila of DRC and Paul Kagame of Rwanda, both arrived in Gabon on Monday to attend the AU summit. The meeting is being held in Libreville since President Omar Bongo of Gabon holds the rotating chairmanship of the AU Peace and Security Commission."
Security Council urges adherence to peace deal,"A UN Security Council mission left Cote d’Ivoire’s economic capital, Abidjan, on Wednesday, promising to hold to account key players who did not adhere to a peace deal signed in January 2003. “We will hold accountable everyone here for their contribution, those who contribute positively, and indeed those who seek to obstruct [peace],” said Sir Emyr Jones Parry, head of the mission. “Those who wish to obstruct should not assume that it will be business as usual,” warned Parry, who is Britain’s permanent representative to the United Nations. Diplomatic sources who declined to be named told IRIN on Thursday that the Security Council was considering levying sanctions against Cote d’Ivoire. Sanctions would likely target the guilty parties, and not the entire Ivorian population, they said, adding that all political actors, including President Laurent Gbagbo, opposition leaders and the rebels, could be targeted. Cote d’Ivoire, once a model of stability in West Africa, was rocked by a coup d’etat in 1999. Less than three years later, in September 2002, a failed uprising in Abidjan developed into a rebellion that divided the country. The rebels, known as the New Forces, continue to occupy the north while the government holds the south. An accord signed in January 2003 in Marcoussis, France, paved the way for a power-sharing government including parties loyal to the president, opposition groups and rebels. In March 2004, however, opposition and New Forces ministers walked out of the government after more than 100 of their supporters were killed by security forces and pro-Gbagbo militias as they tried to stage a demonstration for peace. In May, Gbagbo responded to the boycott by sacking three opposition ministers, including New Forces leader Guillaume Soro. The Security Council mission, representing 14 of the 15 Security Council members, arrived in Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday from Ghana, where it began an eight-day West African tour to promote ""coherent policy-making"" in a region wracked by more than a decade of war. Speaking to the press in Abidjan on Wednesday, just before the mission left for Liberia, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, France’s ambassador to the UN, called on all sides to adhere to the terms of the Marcoussis Agreement. “The Security Council expects all parties in Cote d’Ivoire to respect the engagements they have undertaken,"" he said at the press conference, which followed meetings with President Laurent Gbabgo and Prime Minister Seydou Diarra. “We repeated the aim, which I think is shared by the president, to allow free, open and transparent elections in October 2005. Marcoussis is the way to do this,"" de la Sabliere said. The Security Council mandated a UN peacekeeping force of more than 6,000 for Cote d’Ivoire, the country's first, in March."
Peace process deadlocked with time running out before planned elections,"It's impossible to organise elections as scheduled, one African diplomat in war-divided Cote d'Ivoire sighed. ""The reason no-one is saying it officially is because they don't want to annoy the mediators."" Ivorians are supposed to go to the polls on 30 October to restore peace to a country that was once an oasis of prosperity and stability in West Africa but for the last three years has been spilt into a government-run south and a rebel-held north. The African Union picked South African president Thabo Mbeki to oversee Cote d'Ivoire's transition to peace but he is repeatedly running up against obstacles, and dealing with each one is running down precious days on the elections timetable. The latest dispute is over a series of laws passed by Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo in mid-July on nationality, identity and the electoral process. The South African mediation last week gave the reforms the green light, saying they conformed to the peace process, but the rebels have protested and are refusing to move into cantonment sites ahead of an eventual disarmament. ""The crux of the blockage is the electoral commission,"" one Western diplomat told IRIN. Despite the fact there are just over two months to go until the planned polls, the Independent Electoral Commission is still not up and running because there is disagreement about what its responsibilities are. Gbagbo wants the National Statistics Institute to handle the drawing up of the electoral register and the distribution of voting cards as it always has done. But the opposition and the rebels are wary because the statistics body is controlled by the government and they fear it could distribute cards only to those who will vote for Gbagbo. Sources close to the mediation say the South Africans agreed with all parties that the statistics institute would hold on to its tasks but would carry them out only under the direct control of the electoral commission, where the opposition and rebel parties would also have seats. But the rebels are still unhappy, and on Wednesday began a meeting to decide whether they still had faith in Mbeki as a mediator and whether they would send representatives to sit on the elections body after all. ""Even if everything came together on the political front this very moment though, there are still technical issues to deal with,"" the African diplomat said. For example, voter registers that were supposed to be published three months before election day have yet to be updated let alone displayed for citizens to check. A South African delegation headed to the rebel stronghold, Bouake, on Thursday to try to break the deadlock, and rebel leaders are expected to fly to Pretoria at the weekend to see Mbeki, diplomats said."
"October elections ""not possible"", Annan","In a new blow to hopes for an imminent peace in Cote d'Ivoire, UN chief Kofi Annan has said that key elections slated to heal the nation's strife cannot technically take place as scheduled on 30 October. Annan blamed all sides for the latest hitch in the three year stand-off sparked by a failed coup in September 2002, in an interview with Radio France International on Thursday which is to be aired this weekend. ""It's not going to be possible [to hold the election] because the political leaders and parties have not cooperated,"" said Annan. ""There are certain things that must be done before the elections in October. We haven't even been able to constitute the electoral commission. Practically, on a technical level, it is not possible,"" he said. With seven weeks left before ballots were to be cast, voters' lists have not been updated, many voters are yet to be identified and the electoral commission due to spearhead the vote is not even up and running. Annan's declaration is the first official acknowledgement from the UN, which is overseeing organisation of the polls, that the presidential elections needs to be postponed and comes after weeks of publicly expressed doubts about the possibility of the ballot. Annan warned that the time had come for political action and goodwill, and that if not, UN sanctions could follow. ""I think sooner or later the UN Security Council is obliged to act,"" he said in answer to a question on the possibility of sanctions. Now that the ballot stands to be postponed, all sides are preparing for a heated debate on the transition. President Laurent Gbagbo has already said that his mandate does not expire until a new head of state can be sworn in. But the rebel New Forces, who control the north of the country, and opposition leaders claim there will be a constitutional void after 30 October. They insist that a transitional government should be put in place, without Gbagbo taking part. Article 38 of the Ivorian constitution stipulates that the incumbent stays in power if planned presidential elections cannot 'progress normally' or in the event that poll results cannot be announced. Rebel and opposition leaders have rejected Article 38 as irrelevant in this instance. According to the opposition alliance that comprises the main Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire (PDCI) and the Rally of the Republicans (RDR), article 38 does not provide for the current situation because the elections have not started yet. ""We have pointed out already that the voters' lists have not been published, the belligerent parties have not disarmed and the nation is still divided,"" said PDCI member Maurice Akaou Guikahue. ""There is not even an electoral commission, so how we can say that the election process is 'in progress'?"" he said. For Guikahue, the main problem is ensuring that every Ivorian is able to vote come polling day. ""The fundamental problem is, what are we going to do to make sure that every Ivorian in this country has proper identity papers and will be eligible to vote? As long as the matter of identification is not resolved, we can not organise free and fair elections,"" he said. The New Forces have invited UN special envoy Pierre Schori to the rebel capital Bouake next week to discuss a transition, according to rebel spokesman Alain Lobognon. ""We are engaged in discussions about a transitional government which is the only way to end this crisis,"" he told IRIN. However, Gbagbo warned in a cabinet meeting on Thursday that the successive peace deals signed since January 2003 do not mention a transition. ""The president reaffirms his willingness to apply the constitution, the whole constitution and nothing but the constitution,"" a statement issued after the meeting said."
UN mulls next move as officials warn on tight timeframe for elections,"The UN Security Council will meet next week to decide on its next move to push Cote d’Ivoire back towards peace as UN officials in Abidjan warn that the clock is ticking if elections are to be held on schedule in October. “I wouldn’t say there’s been any quantum leap forward since December,” Alan Doss, the UN’s Deputy Special Representative to Cote d’Ivoire, told IRIN following a fresh visit by South African President Thabo Mbeki, the official mediator, this week. “We are still working towards that October deadline, but yes it becomes ever more difficult every day that goes by and we don’t see progress in some of these areas,” he said. “We would have wished to have been further down the road, no doubt about it.” An African Union meeting in the Gabonese capital, Libreville, on Monday urged the United Nations to hold off bringing a second wave of sanctions into force against key individuals in Cote d'Ivoire in order to give Mbeki's mediation effort more time to bear fruit. Sources at the Security Council in New York said that its sanctions committee would comply with the AU's request by deferring the planned imposition of travel bans and asset freezes against individuals who were regarded as obstacles to the peace process. But they said the sanctions committee might forge ahead with measures against those accused of committing human rights violations and stoking up hatred in the media. “For those blocking the peace process, at this point we can do nothing because the South African mediation is going on. We will have to wait,” a diplomatic source at the 15-nation Security Council told IRIN on Thursday. “But we can move forward on two criteria – human rights and hate media.” He said the sanctions committee was waiting to access the annex of a UN human rights report, which contains some 200 names, as well as a dossier listing the contents of hate messages in the media. These two documents would provide the grist for next week’s discussions. Diplomatic sources in Abidjan and New York said the Security Council was also likely to respond next week to a request from UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan for an additional 1,200 UN peacekeepers in Cote d'Ivoire, which has been split in two since civil war erupted in September 2002. Meanwhile France, the former colonial power in Cote d'Ivoire, which has 4,000 peacekeeping troops under its own command in the West African country, has drafted a new resolution to toughen up a UN arms embargo that was imposed in mid-November. The ban on arms sales to both the government and rebel forces occupying the north of the country, was imposed after President Laurent Gbagbo shattered an 18-month ceasefire by bombing the rebel-held north. "
Slim pickings for Mbeki to report at AU summit,"South African President Thabo Mbeki will brief the African Union (AU) on Monday on Cote d’Ivoire’s attempts to restore peace, but there is little progress to report, with the stalemate between the President Laurent Gbagbo and the rebels as strong as ever. Rebel ministers have still not returned to the government of national reconciliation. Gbagbo is still demanding a referendum be held on a key constitutional change. The rebels are refusing to disarm until their demands for further guarantees have been met. So the prospect of elections being held on schedule in a united country in October looks remote. “We are very pessimistic. We’re not convinced that Mbeki’s efforts will be effective,” said one Abidjan diplomat. “We’re essentially back to where we were a year ago – a game where no side will give anything to the other and everyone lies to each other.” Mbeki, drafted in by the AU to spearhead peace efforts after an 18-month ceasefire fell apart in November, managed to wrangle promises out of both sides on 6 December to a revive faltering two-year-old peace accord. That prompted the UN Security Council to hold off imposing individual sanctions on Cote d’Ivoire’s key players so that the African mediation had time to bear fruit. The peace process in Cote d’Ivoire, split into a rebel-held north and a government-run south since September 2002, has not gathered momentum since Mbeki announced that he had struck a deal more than a month ago. The international community, which has sent 6,000 UN peacekeepers and 5,000 French troops under separate command to prevent further conflict in Cote d’Ivoire, must therefore decide what to do next. A summit meeting of the AU’s 15-member Peace and Security Council in the Gabonese capital Libreville will hear a report from Mbeki on Monday. The UN Security Council will decide whether or not to slap further sanctions on Cote d’Ivoire soon afterwards. Leaks to the press have suggested that up to 200 government and rebel members could be banned from travelling abroad, have their assets seized or be arraigned for trial by an international court for war crimes if the United Nations decides to take tougher action. Reforms through parliament The one concrete piece of progress since Mbeki struck a deal with the Ivorian factions is that the National Assembly has voted through the remaining political reforms promised by the January 2003 Linas-Marcoussis peace agreement, including a reform of article 35 of the constitution. The reform of article 35 allows individuals with only one Ivorian parent to run for the presidency. This means that Alassane Ouattara, a previously-banned opposition leader backed by the rebels, could run against Gbagbo next time around. Ouattara, a former prime minister and senior official of the International Monetary Fund, was banned from challenging Gbagbo in the 2000 presidential election on the disputed grounds that his father was born in Burkina Faso. However, some commentators say that parliamentary approval of the constitutional amendment was cosmetic, because Gbagbo is still demanding that the change to article 35 be rubber-stamped by a referendum. That would be virtually impossible to hold until the rebels disarm and the country is reunited. On most of the other issues outlined in Mbeki’s schedule for peace, Cote d’Ivoire’s warring sides get a poor report card. Gbagbo has kept his man at the head of state television instead of reinstating the previous rebel-backed incumbent. His ousting was branded a “coup” by Guillaume Soro, the rebel leader, who is supposed to be Communications Minister, in charge of the state media. Rebel no-show Meanwhile, Soro and eight other rebel ministers have continued to boycott cabinet meetings, despite promises they would start attending them within two weeks of the Mbeki agreement. They failed to show for the first cabinet meeting of 2005 on Thursday, prompting Prime Minister Seydou Diarra to fly to the rebel stronghold of Bouake that same day to try to persuade them to return to work. Government sources said Diarra had touted the possibility of a one-off cabinet get-together in Yamoussoukro to alleviate rebel concerns that their security cannot be guaranteed in Abidjan. Given that the cabinet is not meeting yet, the timetable for trickier issues like disarmament, looks increasingly unrealistic. Under the Mbeki plan, the disarmament and demobilisation of rebel forces in the north and pro-government militia groups in the south is supposed to be completed by the beginning of April. All this provides much material for the AU to chew over in the absence of Gbagbo. Gabonese officials said on Saturday the Ivorian president had declined an invitation to attend the Libreville summit. The last time AU leaders met to discuss Cote d’Ivoire, following November’s violent flare-up, they came down hard and urged the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo on the country without delay. Given the slow progress since then, there has been speculation that the Libreville summit may call for the United Nations to slap travel bans and asset freezes on those individuals seen as obstacles to peace. Whatever the outcome, Mbeki is set to stop in Cote d’Ivoire on his way home. It will be his third visit to the country in as many months. Officials at the South African president’s office in Pretoria said Mbeki was expected to fly into Cote d’Ivoire’s official capital Yamoussoukro, 200 km northwest of the port city of Abidjan, on Tuesday morning."
UN announces wider human rights probe,"The United Nations has published the official report of its inquiry into the bloody repression of an opposition demonstration on 25 March and has announced plans for a wider probe into human rights abuses since the beginning of the country's civil war in September 2002. The report, which was leaked to Radio France Internationale on 3 May, accused ""the highest authority of the state"" of orchestrating ""the indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians by the security forces."" The official UN report, like its leaked forerunner, said at least 120 people were killed, 20 disappeared and 274 were injured during two days of violence by the police, the army and their paramilitary allies. This was particularly targetted at people from the rebel-held north of Cote d'Ivoire and immigrants from neighbouring countries, it added. The UN Security Council debated the report on Friday and urged ""that those responsible for violations of human rights, in particular those committted on 25-26 March, be held accountable."" However it stopped short of endorsing the implicit charge by the three international human rights investigators who probed the killings that President Laurent Gbagbo was personally responsible for unleashing the bloodshed. The President of the Security Council, Munir Akram, said in a statement that the council welcomed the intention of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to launch a broader commission of inquiry ""to look into events going back to September 2002"" when the civil war began. Diplomats said this would look at human rights abuses committed by the rebels as well as those carried out government forces. Akram also spoke of ""concrete steps"" to ensure that those who are responsible for all the violations of human rights perpetrated in Cote d'Ivoire since September 2002 are held accountable for their actions."" Diplomats said this raised the possibility that a special war crimes tribunal might be created for Cote d'Ivoire, similar to the UN-backed Special Court in Sierra Leone. The report by the UN human rights investigators recommended the establishment of ""a mixed human rights court with the participation of international judges."" Gbagbo rejected their report as ""clearly biassed"" in a letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan which was published by the government daily Fraternite Matin. In the letter, he called for another investigation into the March event, a wider international commission of inquiry to look at human rights abuses in Cote d'Ivoire since the civil war began. The UN Security Council has effectively agreed to that. The government closed down FM relay broadcasts of RFI in Abidjan for 24 hours on Saturday to prevent the French state-run broadcaster from rubbing in the fact that the damming report on the March killings which it published two weeks ago was in fact genuine. The UN dead toll compared with an Ivorian government figure of 37 and opposition estimates of up to 500. A political science professor at the University of Abidjan said on Monday Gbagbo was wasting his time trying to rebutt the conclusions of the UN investigation because these were ""clear cut."" ""He needs to save his breath, there will be more important battles to fight,"" he told IRIN. The rebel ""New Forces"" movement hundred welcomed the publication of the UN report on the March killings, but said any wider human rights investigation in Cote d'Ivoire should go back as far October 2000, when Gbagbo was elected president. Several dozen people died in an outburst of political violence immediately after that election, 57 of whom were subsequently discovered buried in a mass grave. ""We are not totally satisfied,"" Amadou Kone, a senior aide to rebel leader Guillaume Soro told IRIN. He noted in particular that the Security Council had not taken any formal steps towards setting up an international tribunal to try those responsible for human rights abuses in Cote d'Ivoire. Opposition newspapers in Abidjan had speculated that the Security Council might impose travel sanctions on Gbagbo and certain members of his entourage and freeze their assets overseas in immitation of measures taken against Charles Taylor when he was president of Liberia. Gbagbo appears to have been lobbying hard to ward off any UN sanctions against himself or his government. He travelled to the Cape Verde islands last week to meet Angolan president Jose Eduardo dos Santos who was in transit to the United States and then to Tripoli to meet Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. A few days earlier, he flew to neighbouring Guinea where he met with President Lansana Conte. His efforts were rewarded when Gaddafi told a West African summit in Mali at the weekend that the international community should keep its nose out of Cote d'Ivoire. The Libyan leader endorsed Gbagbo as an elected president and dismissed the rebels as ""trouble makers"" and ""adventurers.""

Mbeki gets more time to mediate but runs into trouble,"African leaders gave South African President Thabo Mbeki more time to negotiate peace in Cote d’Ivoire, but his mediation initiative ran into trouble hours later when rebels boycotted a special cabinet meeting on Tuesday at which he was guest of honour. A rebel spokesman accused Mbeki, who has been trying to broker a peace deal for the past two months, of “betrayal.” The African Union’s Peace and Security Council wrapped up a summit in the Gabonese capital, Libreville, in the early hours of Tuesday morning, with a plea to all the Ivorian factions to overcome political sticking points and proceed with disarmament to pave the way for elections in October. It also recommended that the UN Security Council delay imposing travel bans and asset freezes on key individuals seen as blocking the peace process in order to give Mbeki more time. But rebel leaders failed to turn up for a planned meeting with Mbeki in Cote d'Ivoire's official capital Yamoussoukro on Tuesday afternoon, saying they would prefer to see him later in South Africa. The rebels, who have occupied the northern half of Cote d’Ivoire since civil war erupted in September 2002, may have been irked by the AU's refusal to call for further UN sanctions on the country. Shortly before the Libreville summit, the G7 coalition, which groups Cote d’Ivoire’s New Forces rebel movement and the four main opposition parties in parliament, issued a statement accusing President Laurent Gbagbo of preparing for an imminent return to war. It urged the United Nations to impose a second round of sanctions immediately. An 18-month ceasefire between Gbagbo and the rebels was broken in early November, when government forces launched an abortive offensive to try and recapture the north. The flare-up in violence prompted the AU to call in Mbeki, a seasoned mediator, to try and put Cote d’Ivoire’s flagging peace process back on track. Getting everyone around cabinet table A key step would be to get the country’s power-sharing government of national reconciliation working again. The rebels have been boycotting cabinet meetings in the main city Abidjan for months, saying their security cannot be guaranteed there. Diplomats had hoped that by moving the venue of Tuesday’s cabinet meeting from Cote d’Ivoire’s main city Abidjan, where pro-Gbagbo mobs often rule the streets, to Yamoussoukro,200 km to the north, and by having Mbeki at the table, the rebels could be persuaded to return. But they refused to come. “We are very disappointed by the Libreville summit. They gave Gbagbo a back door,” rebel spokesman Sidiki Konate told IRIN by telephone from Bouake. “The population has been betrayed by the South Africans. It’s a step backwards for which there is no precedent.” Before the cabinet meeting began, officials close to Gbagbo said a no-show by the rebels would spell only one thing. “If they don’t come, it will show us that they don’t want to disarm and they don’t want peace. The international community should draw lessons from that,” a senior presidential aide told IRIN. South African diplomats said they were still trying to convince New Forces leader, Guillaume Soro, to meet Mbeki before the president returns home. But Konate said the rebels didn’t think Yamoussoukro was a safe venue. He said they had asked to see the South African leader in Pretoria instead. Another thing that may have annoyed the rebels was an AU statement in Libreville that Gbagbo was entitled to hold a referendum on a controversial constitutional amendment. The G7 opposition alliance believes that parliamentary approval of the reform, which allows people with only one Ivorian parent to run for head of state, should suffice. The immediate beneficiary of constitutional ammendment would be Alassane Ouattara, an exiled opposition learder who is popular in the north. He was banned from running against Gbagbo in the 2000 presidential election on the disputed grounds his father was from Burkina Faso. “The Council recognizes that a referendum is one of the options – not the exclusive one – to which the President could have recourse, providing it is organised in a way which respects the spirit of Linas-Marcoussis,” the AU said in a statement. Linas-Marcoussis is a suburb of Paris where the Ivorian factions negotiated a peace agreement two years ago. The deal thrashed out there still forms the blueprint for Mbeki’s peace initiative. Keeping spirit of Linas-Marcoussis Diplomats say privately that anyone campaigning against the constitutional change after parliament had approved the measure by an overwhelming majority, would be betraying the spirit of Linas-Marcoussis. Many also question whether there is enough time left to hold a referendum before presidential polls set for October. But officials close to the Ivorian president told IRIN insisted there was. “I’ll take you back to the year 2000 when there was a referendum in July and elections followed in October so why can’t we do the same thing this year?” one senior aide of Gbagbo said. But diplomats note that for a referendum to take place Cote d’Ivoire would have to be reunited and the rebels would have to disarm first. Mbeki’s proposed timetable for putting the peace process back on track, agreed with Gbagbo and the rebels on 6 December, envisaged disarmament starting on 15 January and ending by early April. UN officials say the cantonment sites are ready. But Konate, the rebel spokesman, said categorically on Tuesday that no rebel fighters would be handing in their guns this week. “There will be no disarmament,” he said. With no breakthrough in sight in Mbeki's mediation efforts, the AU Peace and Security Council has urged the United Nations to increase the number of UN peacekeepers in Cote d’Ivoire and give them a stronger mandate. Some 6,000 UN peacekeepers along with 4,000 French soldiers are deployed in the West African country to keep the two sides apart. Last month UN Secretary General Kofi Annan recommended that the UN force be increased to 7,466 after several days of mob violence in November left it “strained to the limit.” The UN Security Council has not so far reacted to this request."
UN endorses plan to leave president in office beyond mandate,"The United Nations Security Council on Friday endorsed a peace plan for Cote d’Ivoire enabling President Laurent Gbagbo to remain on as head of state after his current mandate expires on 30 October. The peace blueprint, which was worked out last week at an African Union (AU) summit, has been criticised by the opposition as well as by the rebel forces in control of the northern half of the West African country. ""The Security Council endorses the decision of the Peace and Security Council of the African Union on the situation in Cote d’Ivoire,"" read the presidential statement from the UN Security Council. But the body made clear that it was withholding any commitment on a substantial increase to the 6,600-strong peacekeeping force, as requested by the AU at its Addis summit. Cote d’Ivoire, the world’s top cocoa producer and once a regional beacon of peace and prosperity, has been split in two since September 2002, with the UN troops monitoring a buffer zone between the rebel north and loyalist south. The AU plan calls for President Gbagbo to remain in office “for a period not exceeding 12 months” after his term expires 30 October. That was the date when new elections were to have been held under the terms of the latest in a series of botched peace deals. But the failure of the rebels and of pro-government militia to hand in weapons beforehand has scuttled plans to hold the elections on deadline. To help steer the country until elections are held, the AU plan also calls for the appointment of a new prime minister acceptable to all parties. In a statement, the 15-member Security Council said it would support the holding of “free, fair, open, transparent and credible elections as soon as possible and no later than 30 October 2006.” On a troop increase, the statement said members of the Security Council had taken note of the request and would consider reinforcements “based on a careful study of conditions in the country and of evidence of meaningful progress toward implementation of longstanding commitments"" under a 2003 peace deal. The Security Council also welcomed an upcoming visit to Cote d’Ivoire by AU leader and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and South African President Thabo Mbeki, who mediated the latest Ivorian peace deal on behalf of the AU. The visit is expected to take place in the next few days, according to South African officials. It will be followed by a trip to the West African nation by the head of the UN’s Sanctions Committee, which has threatened travel and assets freezes against individuals holding up peace. Obasanjo and Mbeki will face a hard task convincing Gbagbo’s opponents to sign on."
West African leaders want more UN peacekeepers,"West African leaders want the United Nations to significantly strengthen its peacekeeping force in Cote d’Ivoire to ensure new efforts to end the three-year war there finally pay off, Senegal’s Foreign Minister Cheikh Tidiane Gadio said on Monday. Gadio said that the call for more blue helmets was one of a dozen proposals made at a special one-day summit on the Ivorian crisis, which brought together leaders from the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Friday. The conclusions of the crisis summit have not been made public. Gadio said ECOWAS leaders had been asked to leave copies of the proposals behind in the conference room and that the plans would be submitted to a bigger gathering of the African Union (AU) in Addis Ababa on Thursday. A week after the Addis summit, the UN Security Council is set to examine the AU's ideas for reunifying divided Cote d’Ivoire, split between a rebel-held north and a loyalist south since September 2002. “UN forces must be strengthened,” Gadio told reporters in Dakar. “They must be strengthened in sufficient numbers.” He gave no figures but said that many more than a thousand troops were needed. “Soldiers will even have to go house to house to recover arms” once a disarmament deal is in place, he said. “Some homes have become arms caches.” A total 6,640 peacekeepers are currently serving in the UN force, which is under Senegalese command, monitoring the buffer zone between the north and south with the help of 4,000 French troops. UN Special Representative Pierre Schori had asked for 2,000 more men this year, but the UN Security Council approved just over 800 in June. The Senegalese minister said added means and swift - “within 24-hours” - sanctions were necessary to avoid a new flare-up of war in Cote d’Ivoire, once the region’s economic powerhouse and a beacon of stability. Tension has been rising in Cote d’Ivoire ahead of 30 October, the date when Gbagbo's current mandate was supposed to end with fresh elections, according to the terms of the latest in a series of peace deals. But like earlier accords, the so-called Pretoria deal crumbled and everyone -- from Gbagbo, to the rebels, the UN -- has acknowledged that the ballot cannot be held on schedule. Rebels in the north have refused to disarm, pro-Gbagbo militia in the south have failed to hand in weapons, electoral registers have not been updated and the country is still divided. Gbagbo meanwhile has said he has the constitutional right to remain in office until a new election is held, while the opposition and the rebels insist that he must stand down and allow a transitional authority to take his place. ”The fate of Cote d’Ivoire concerns us all,” Gadio said. “It was the economic motor of West Africa, the region’s most powerful country.” He said the proposals being passed on to the AU by ECOWAS were “very balanced” and should be acceptable to all sides in the conflict. They were based on the original Linas-Marcoussis peace deal struck in 2003, but incorporated the later accords struck at talks in Accra and Pretoria. French Foreign Minister Philippe Douse-Blazy on Monday called for a swift resumption of the Ivorian electoral process, saying presidential elections should be organised at the beginning of 2006. “We must move quickly,” he told Radio France Internationale. In Dakar, the Senegalese minister said that whether the elections were held in 3, 6 or 12 months “the most important thing is that the people and the politicians must sign on.”"
West African leaders try to revive flagging peace efforts,"West African leaders have met for an extraordinary summit aimed at reviving flagging efforts to bring peace to divided Cote d’Ivoire although the country’s president refused to attend. Winding up the talks in the Nigerian capital late Friday, leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) publicly issued no new proposals to end the three-year crisis, instead referring the matter to next week's wider African Union (AU) summit, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Ivorian leader Laurent Gbagbo boycotted the talks after accusing ECOWAS of bias towards the rebels, who seized control of the northern half of the cocoa-rich nation in 2002. After the AU summit 6 October, the United Nations Security Council is due to consider the crisis in Cote d’Ivoire on 13 October. In a statement, ECOWAS leaders “expressed deep concern about the persistence and the deterioration of the situation in the country, a situation with the potential to destabilize the entire West African Sub-region."" The summit significantly said that a recent peace deal known as the Pretoria Accord that was brokered by AU mediator and South African President Thabo Mbeki, along with two previous failed accords, the Linas Marcoussis and Accra III agreements, were their preferred framework for the peaceful resolution of the crisis. On the eve of the talks, the UN envoy to the once prosperous and peaceful Cote d'Ivoire warned that the country once again stood teetering on the brink of war. “We are far off from national reconciliation and this dangerous atmosphere explains why ECOWAS, the AU and the UN are becoming involved,” Pierre Schori told reporters in Abidjan, the de facto capital, before heading to the Nigerian capital for the summit. Schori said tension was rising ahead of 30 October, the date when Gbagbo's current mandate was supposed to end with fresh elections sealing the peace, according to the terms of the Pretoria Accord. But like earlier accords the deal crumbled and everyone -- from Gbagbo, to the rebels, the UN -- has acknowledged that the ballot cannot be held. Rebels in the north have refused to disarm, pro-Gbagbo militia in the south have failed to hand in weapons, electoral registers have not been updated and the country is still divided. Gbagbo meanwhile has said he has the constitutional right to remain in office until a new election is held, while the opposition and the rebels insist that he must stand down and allow a transitional authority to take his place. At the Abuja talks, attended by nine West African leaders, Gbagbo’s delegates circulated documents stating that he had respected pledges made under the Pretoria Accord though the rebels had not. “I was the sole signatory of the accords to have held to my commitments,” the president told the Ivorian nation in a speech broadcast on state radio and television this week. He announced he would boycott the ECOWAS summit on the grounds that some countries backed the insurgents. “Cote d’Ivoire will never agree to allow these countries to decide its fate while they are both judges and players,” he said. Meanwhile the rebels have rebuffed further mediation efforts by Mbeki and said they will have no further dealings with him. In this stalemate, analysts say ECOWAS, the AU and the UN will have few options other than proposing new election deadlines and hardening the threat of sanctions against individuals holding up the accord."
Another year of stalemate in the peace process,"Two years after the outbreak of civil war, Cote d'Ivoire remains partitioned and unstable. The guns have fallen silent, but none of the underlying causes of the conflict have been resolved. Diplomats and political analysts worry that the prospects for holding free and fair presidential elections in October 2005 are increasingly uncertain. Deadline after deadline for implementing political reforms agreed under the terms of a January 2003 peace accord has been missed, pushing the West African country from one crisis to another. There has been no relapse into full-scale fighting, but ethnic killings have continued in government-held areas of western Cote d'Ivoire and rival factions of the rebel movement have periodically clashed with each other in the north. Two separate UN human rights investigations have accused both sides of killing unarmed civilians. And throughout the country idle gunmen lounge at roadblocks extorting bribes from passing vehicles. Jean M'Bahia, a sociology professor at Abidjan University, said Cote d'Ivoire was now so polarised along tribal and political lines that he doubted that elections by themselves would provide a solution to its problems. ""Elections won't necessarily usher in peace because the crisis has left the political sphere. Things have become personal,"" he told IRIN. One diplomat in West Africa warned that Cote d'Ivoire should not be pushed into elections while the rebellion, which began on 19 September 2002, was unresolved. Elections were held in Cambodia in 1992 when disarmament was only 30 percent complete and 12 years later the country was still not at peace, he noted. Latest peace deal runs into problems The latest deal to try and put the shaky peace process back on track was agreed by President Laurent Gbagbo, the rebel movement occupying the north of the country and the main opposition parties represented in parliament, at a crisis meeting in the Ghanaian capital Accra at the end of July. A dozen African heads of state were present, breathing down the necks of the rival factions to force a compromise. Under the terms of the resulting ""Accra Three"" agreement, Gbagbo agreed to push long-delayed political reforms onto the statute book by the end of August. These are aimed at giving immigrants to Cote d'Ivoire from other West African countries and their descendents stronger rights to inherit land, take up Ivorian nationality and run for the presidency. The rebels pledged at Accra that once the reforms were duly enacted, they would start to disarm on 15 October under the supervision of a 6,000 strong-UN peacekeeping force and 4,000 French peacekeepers deployed alongside them. Meanwhile, the opposition parties and the rebels agreed to return immediately to a power-sharing government of national reconciliation, ending a boycott of more than five months. But August came and went without a single political reform making it through parliament following blocking tactics by Gbagbo's Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) party. The different factions were not even able to agree on the composition of an electoral commission that is due to supervise next year's elections. Mamadou Koulibaly, the speaker of parliament and a hardline leader of the FPI, said last week that he did not believe the rebels would start to disarm on schedule in October. But his remark surprised no-one. The rebels have one card to play The rebels occupy the northern half of Cote d'Ivoire, a country of 16 million people, richly endowed with tropical rainforest and Savannah farmlands. But once they start handing in their guns under the planned programme of Disarmament, Demobilisaton and Rehabilitation (DDR) and surrender control of their territory to the government, the insurgents will have no further political leverage. ""The Forces Nouvelles (rebel movement) have one card to play: DDR,"" said Stephen Ellis, the outgoing director of the African affairs at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank. ""They will use it to get as many guarantees as possible before turning in their weapons."" ""Their weapons are their sole bargaining chip,"" agreed one former Ivorian journalist, who has since carved out a career for himself as a political consultant. ""Once they give that up, what are they left with?"" Meanwhile there are pressures on both sides to end the current stand-off. The international community has starved the government of aid funds pending a resolution of the political impasse and the start of disarmament and this has aggravated an economic crisis prompted by the partition of the country. The World Bank alone, which suspended aid to Cote d'Ivoire in May following an accumulation of debt arrears, has frozen the disbursement of US$331 million. But so far, no-one in the diplomatic community is talking seriously about sanctions to make Gbagbo stick to political commitments given at international meetings, which he consistently ignores as soon as he gets home. Alan Doss, the deputy head of the UN Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (ONUCI) remarked: ""The Security Council hasn't said a thing on sanctions. The Council told the parties that they have the first responsibility and each has a personal responsibility…as far as I know, the Council has not talked about sanctions in open and direct terms."" Serious divisions within the rebel movement The rebels meanwhile are struggling with internal divisions and an economic crisis in the north that is even more serious than in the government-held south of what is still West Africa's most prosperous country. All banks are closed in the north, along with most schools and health centres. Its factories have shut down, trade has slowed and its mainly rural population is drifting back to subsistence farming. And Guillaume Soro, the rebel leader, is grappling to control a faction-ridden rebel movement at the same time as dealing with Gbagbo. Increasingly the authority of Soro, a 35-year-old former student leader, is being challenged by Master-Sargent Ibrahim Coulibaly, a former non-commissioned officer in the Ivorian army. He played a key role in planning the successful 1999 coup led by General Robert Guei and is widely believed to have been a mastermind of the botched 2002 coup attempt which led to civil war instead. Coulibaly, who is popularly known as IB, has been based in exile in Paris for the past year, but his supporters in the rebel movement in Cote d'Ivoire have clashed repeatedly with the faction loyal to Soro back home. The most serious incident took place in the northern city of Korhogo on 20 and 21 June, following what Soro claimed was an attempt to assassinate him. Two days of heavy fighting ensued. Soro's faction gained control and UN human rights investigators who visited the city later found the bodies of at least 99 people buried in mass graves. Many of them appeared to have suffocated to death in overcrowded containers used as a makeshift prison after being rounded up as suspected IB supporters. ""The rebellion is currently fighting Gbagbo militarily and politically while fighting its own demons,"" one former rebel supporter who still lives in the rebel capital Bouake, told IRIN. But he stressed that the rival factions would still unite to face their common enemy. ""This is a well-organized movement with friends inside and out who are making sure that they keep on fighting what they took up arms for,"" he said. No change in the political landscape At this time last year, the political landscape in Cote d'Ivoire looked depressingly similar. Gbagbo, a former history professor who was an opposition activist for 30 years until he came to power in the 2000 presidential election, was dragging his heals over the implementation of reforms agreed in the French-brokered Linas-Marcoussis peace agreement. The rebels, meanwhile, were holding their own ground and refusing to disarm until the reforms were in place. Since then, the rebels have twice pulled out of the the broad-based government of national reconciliation, led by Prime Minister Seydou Diarra. The rebels first withdrew their nine ministers in September 2003 in protest at Gbagbo's refusal to implement agreed political reforms, returning eventually in December. Then they quit the cabinet for a second time in March 2004, along with 17 other ministers representing the four main opposition parties in parliament. The entire opposition pulled out in protest at Gbagbo's heavy handed repression of a banned demonstration in Abidjan. According to a subsequent UN human rights investigation, soldiers, policemen and shadowy gunmen linked to pro-Gbagbo militia groups killed at least 120 people, mainly in poor suburbs of the city suspected of sympathy with the rebel cause. The power-sharing government was reconstituted in early August following the Accra Three agreement, but so far there has been no progress in moving forward on the political reforms aimed at placating the rebels' core supporters in northern Cote d'Ivoire and the four million people in the country of immigrant origin, who feel themselves excluded from power by the present laws. Amending the constitution Their frustration is exemplified by article 35 of the constitution which states that both parents of a presidential candidate must be born in Cote d'Ivoire. This was used as a pretext to prevent former prime minister Alassane Ouattara, a popular figure in the north, from running against Gbagbo in the 2000 election. Ouattara's exclusion from the contest and a similar ban imposed on Henri Konan-Bedie, the civilian president overthrown by General Guei in 1999, turned the election into a straight fight between Gbagbo and the military strongman who had seized power. Gbagbo won and Guei was killed in the early hours of the rebellion that triggered the civil war two years ago. The Linas-Marcoussis peace agreement calls for article 35 to be modified so that Ouattara can run in 2005, but Gbagbo and the FPI have consistently put obstacles in the way of changing it. So where does Cote d'Ivoire go from here? On the plus side, the various parties have been cajoled back into the government of national reconciliation. Diarra, its prime minister, is a politically independent former civil servant respected by all sides who is viewed by the international community as the lynchpin of the peace process in Cote d'Ivoire. ""We are not in a Liberia situation"" And unlike neighbouring Liberia, which was totally destroyed by 14 years of civil war, the economic infrastructure in Cote d'Ivoire remains intact. Abidjan, a city of modern skyscrapers and urban freeways, has been untouched by the fighting. The country's tarred roads are still in good condition, the electricity supply and telephone systems work - supplying customers in the rebel zone for free at present. Meanwhile exports of cocoa and coffee, the two main export crops, continue albeit at a slightly reduced level. Poverty and unemployment are steadily increasing since investment in the economy has ground to a halt, but once the country has been reunited and the million or more people who have been displaced from their homes by the fighting are able to return, normal life should be able to resume very quickly. ""We are not in a Liberia situation here,"" said Doss, who until recently headed the UN operation that rescued Sierra Leone from a decade long civil war. ""The crisis has gone on quite long, but the actual conflict was relatively short. And certaintly from my experience in Sierra Leone the level of destruction doesn't begin to approach that."" There is also a consensus view, both among the rival factions in Cote d'Ivoire, the United Nations and most independent observers, that there is still time to prepare for meaningful elections next year. ""Cote d'Ivoire is not a failed state,"" Ellis at ICG explained. ""Logistically, the elections can be held at short notice. Some countries, like East Timor, were in a weaker position,"" he noted. Doss at ONUCI agreed. ""There seems to be a consenus that we must have our elections no later than October 2005,"" he told IRIN. ""I think free and fair elections were seen as the apex of the peace efforts and I think everybody seems committed to that, so let's all work towards that deadline."" But although the way forward remains unclear, diplomats and political analysts agree that national reconciliation must come from within Cote d'Ivoire - it cannot be imposed by the international community - and that Gbagbo, who wields immense personal power, must lead the way. ""The question is what can Ivorians do? We can't be a substitute for the national will to seek a solution and reconciliation,"" Doss said. ""Gbagbo has an obligation towards the population,"" Ellis stressed. ""Politics is the art of the possible and creative politicians try to find solutions to problems."" Meanwhile, about 500,000 people internally displaced within Cote d'Ivoire and about 500,000 more immigrants from Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea who have fled back to their countries of origin to escape persecution, the children in the north who cannot go to school and the army of unemployed youths in Abidjan are waiting for the solution to appear."
Annan says UN mission needs more troops after latest flare-up,"The UN Mission in Cote d'Ivoire (ONUCI) needs reinforcing with more than 1,200 military personnel after days of mob violence in the West African nation last month left it ""strained to the limit"", Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Tuesday. ""The crisis has highlighted the limitations of the Mission when faced by massive unrest and attacks against certain groups of civilians that are clearly orchestrated, organised and undertaken in a climate of impunity,"" Annan said in his latest report to the Security Council on Cote d'Ivoire. ONUCI currently has around 6,000 peacekeepers in the former French colony, that has been split into a government-controlled and a rebel-held north for more than two years. But the events of early November prompted a rethink. Government troops shattered an 18-month ceasefire and began bombarding rebel territory paving the way for a ground assault to crush the rebel New Forces movement. The offensive came to an abrupt halt when nine French peacekeepers were killed in a raid. Paris retaliated by destroying the Ivorian airforce, triggering a wave of violence that sent 9,000 mainly-French expatriates fleeing and left many homes and business in ruins. Annan suggested the 15-nation council give the green light to an emergency reinforcement in Cote d'Ivoire that would include 850 soldiers and 76 military policemen as well as other extra manpower. ""These adjustments would add total 1,226 military personnel to the current authorised strength of the force of 6,240, thereby increasing its strength to up to 7,466 military personnel,"" Annan said. ""The crisis in the first half of November has strained to the limit ONUCI's capacity to implement its mandate."" The Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS), which has been involved in long-running mediation efforts to solve the crisis in the world's top cocoa grower, had called for a reinforcement of UN peacekeepers last weekend. Annan said on Tuesday that it was not just extra people that were needed but also more resources. He called for a boat unit in Abidjan, which could be used to rescue people or transport troops across the lagoon that divides the city. And he said attack helicopters were needed to back up UN peacekeepers on the ground and present a stronger deterrent. He noted that in November, despite ONUCI's efforts, large numbers of government troops had moved across the buffer zone, which runs through the centre of Cote d'Ivoire, and clashed with rebel forces. Looking further ahead, more reflection was needed. ""The question arises of how protection can best be provided,"" Annan said. ""I would invite the Security Council and regional leaders to consider long-term strategies that could be employed in this pivotal West African country, including by the United Nations."" A spokesman for Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo declined to comment on Annan's latest report, while on the streets of Abidjan, reaction was mixed. ""If more blue helmets come to bring security and to intervene when fighting starts again, that would be very good,"" said Moussa Tanoh, a car parts salesman. ""But if they come as observers who hesitate to intervene until it's too late, they'd better stay home."" Annan's report was published the day before the UN Security Council threatened to impose a second wave of sanctions on anyone obstructing Cote d'Ivoire's peace process. It has already slapped a 13-month arms embargo on the country and is expected to issue a statement formally announcing its decision about individual travel bans and asset freezes on Wednesday or Thursday."
Unemployed and looking for a way to spend the day? Join the President's men,"Jean Martial studied to become an accountant and Olivier trained as a mechanic. Neither ever found a job but neither readily admits to being unemployed. Instead both these Ivorian youths pronounce themselves to be 'Young Patriots'. They devote their time to the hard-line nationalist movement that supports President Laurent Gbagbo and describe their work as defending Cote d’Ivoire against France, the former colonial master, and against rebels occupying the north of the country. ""I finished studying to be a mechanic in 2002. Then the rebels launched their attack in September and that's when I found my new calling,"" Olivier told IRIN at the Sorbonne, a leafy square in downtown Abidjan that is a magnet for soapbox politics. Olivier, like dozens of other youths milling about the square, is decked out in a T-shirt with ""David versus Goliath"" emblazoned on the front. For them the giant Goliath is France and they are weakly underdog David, trying to topple him with a simple slingshot. They have had some success. Mob riots in November, which many diplomats blamed on the Young Patriots, forced France to conduct the largest ever evacuation of its citizens from Africa in recent times. Almost 9,000 expatriates - most of them French - fled Abidjan as crowds of angry youths burned their schools and ransacked their homes. ""France's imperialist rule is to blame for the unemployment,"" said Olivier, seemingly unaware that his favourite downtown hangout shares its name with the elite Parisian university. ""I'm a bit ashamed to be 27 already and still without a salary,"" he admitted, explaining that he relied on his big brother, his extended family and his friends for financial support. ""But I am a patriot, I go on the marches, I take part in the sit-ins. I have a job to do."" Olivier faithfully trots out the Young Patriot mantra, extolling President Gbagbo and ranting against France. But occasionally his mask slips, raising questions about how much of what he says comes from his own convictions. For example, Olivier says that once the war is over he would like to do a computer course and work in Europe. Given that the only European language Olivier speaks is French, his most likely job market would be the country he presently regards as the enemy. But that doesn't seem to bother him. Eternal conundrum Youth employment in Cote d'Ivoire, as in most African countries, is very high and rising fast. According to government statistics, 23 percent of all males under the age of 25 were unemployed when the civil war began in 2002. Cote d'Ivoire's sophisticated economy, which was once the pride of West Africa, has taken a nosedive since then, leaving even more of the country's angry and frustrated youth, idle and without an honest income. Independent estimates are hard to come by, but experts at the forefront of efforts to prevent Cote d'Ivoire's fragile peace process from collapsing agree that high youth unemployment encourages violence and makes everything more complicated. ""Clearly the large numbers of young people without much hope or opportunity has got to be a factor for instability,"" said Alan Doss, the United Nations' acting chief representative in Cote d'Ivoire. ""Young people are more susceptible to violence when they are without opportunity or hope."" ""It’s the eternal conundrum,"" Doss added. ""You need peace to get stability, you need stability to get growth... to get jobs which in turn underpins peace."" Last November offered a startling reminder of just how much repressed anger lies smouldering beneath the surface, waiting for the fuse to be lit. 
[Cote d'Ivoire] ""Young Patriots"" leader Charles Ble-Goude.
Young Patriot leader Charles Ble Goude
After 18 months of uneasy ceasefire, Gbagbo's air force bombed rebel positions in the north in preparation for a ground offensive. When French forces retaliated for the deaths of nine peacekeepers during the raids, by destroying most of the president's warplanes, the Young Patriots were called out onto the streets of Abidjan in force. Giving the order was Charles Ble-Goude, Young Patriot figurehead and university drop-out. Sporting stubble and a baseball cap, he moves around town with armed bodyguards in military uniform and is said by diplomats to take his orders directly from the president's office. At his signal, tens of thousands of young Ivorians surrounded the main French military base near Abidjan airport and a hotel near the presidential palace. But thousands of others ran riot across the city, torching schools and trashing businesses belonging to Cote d'Ivoire's large French expatriate community. They also looted individual homes, sending nearly 9,000 expatriates scarpering home on hastily organised evacuation fights. All the Young Patriots interviewed by IRIN said they had nothing to do with the violence. They all pointed out that there was a mass break-out of 3,000 prisoners from Abidjan's main jail around the time. But the same youths nonetheless expressed satisfaction that the French position in Cote d'Ivoire had been weakened. Today street hawkers at the Sorbonne are doing a brisk trade in commemorative films about the November resistance. The movies include images of the headless corpse of a patriot draped in the Ivorian flag and show French helicopters firing canon shots to prevent a crowd of 50,000 Young Patriots charging across one of the key bridges spanning the city's lagoon to get to the airport. Expats take employment with them In this corner of Abidjan, there is scant mention of the thousands of jobs that disappeared with the expatriate businessmen as they left the country -- something diplomats worry will only exacerbate social and political tensions in this volatile nation of 16 million people. ""With the departure of the French, there are fewer jobs now than there were a couple of months ago. It’s a food chain and when you break the first link... that adds pressure,"" one Western diplomat in Abidjan told IRIN. Despite Gbagbo's enthusiasm to bring in new foreign investors from places such as China and the United States to dilute France's control of much of the economy, few are likely to rush in and fill the void given the political deadlock and the deteriorating infrastructure. ""How can we hope to attract foreign investment, essential for creating the jobs that so many millions of West African youths desperately need, if some of our leaders continue to pursue the logic of war and vendetta year after year?"" lamented Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the UN Special Representative for West Africa after November's fighting. But some youths, like once-aspiring accountant Jean-Martial, see other options. Like many Young Patriots, Jean-Martial denies receiving any payment for his current allegiance to the president. But he is hoping to cash in once peace returns. “I help run one of the Young Patriot forums, working for the party in power. So I hope that when things return to normal, I might be compensated for my efforts,” he told IRIN in a cafe in the suburb of Koumassi. “Because they know we have been fighting for our country, we young people could be favoured.” The Ivorian government says the economy, which is heavily dependent on cocoa and coffee exports, registered zero growth in 2004, but independent economists think it contracted sharply. With no concrete progress towards peace and the flare-ups getting increasingly violent, aid workers, diplomats and UN officials worry that the militia-style Young Patriots may start to spiral out of control. Nothing to do, nothing to go back to ""There’s a lot of unemployed people who have nothing to do. We're not talking about disciplined military movements, these are just young crowds,"" the Western diplomat said. Indeed one resident in Abidjan described how groups of young of men, who used to loiter outside his apartment block, suddenly jumped on the Young Patriot bandwagon during the crisis in November, not for ideological reasons, but more to have something to do.

""When it’s time for these youths to go home they have nothing to go back to,"" the Western diplomat said. ""The danger is that the situation begins to deteriorate and so they begin to take on a life of their own."" It is a worry that is even shared by certain militia leaders, according to one humanitarian worker in the town of Guiglo, an epicentre of ethnic clashes in Cote d'Ivoire's ""Wild West."" He told the story of one local militia leader who journeyed to Abidjan to try to register his small group with the disarmament commission. “He was frightened that if peace came, he wouldn’t have the money to pay his young guns and they might then become a lethal force,"" the aid worker said. ""He wanted the disarmament commission to take charge of ridding them of their weapons and sweeping up the problem."" Although they have yet to swing into action, the UN disarmament plans provide for each demobilised fighter to receive a cash grant of US$900, big money in a country where half the inhabitants live on less than two dollars per day Looking around the West African region, there are troubling precedents for Cote d'Ivoire. In Liberia where drugged-up youths brought terror and bloodbaths to the streets during 14 years of civil war, the UN estimates that 85 percent of the population is unemployed. Even now, 18 months after the conflict ended, there are still legions of young men who have only known life as a combatant and who are struggling to adjust to peace. In Sierra Leone, whose decade-long civil war ended three years ago, the situation is little better. Thousands of demobilised fighters who once hacked off the limbs, lips and ears of innocent civilians still have no other useful occupation to turn to. Doss, who worked for the UN in Sierra Leone before moving to Cote d'Ivoire, is only too aware of where the downward spiral leads. ""Dreadful things were done in Sierra Leone, far worse than thank god we’ve seen so far in this country,"" he said in his Abidjan office. ""And I think that is one very important lesson -- when violence takes hold, you can never control it."""
Disarmament talks continuing after two days,"Talks to agree a disarmament timetable to end Cote d’Ivoire’s three-year civil war were continuing on Friday evening after two days of efforts to reach agreement. As dusk fell over the official capital of the world’s top cocoa producer, officials said the two sides in the conflict - rebels who hold the north and government forces who control the south - were still fine-tuning a deal. Meanwhile President Laurent Gbagbo took steps to ease the peace process by pledging on Thursday to push through legislative reforms as agreed at a peace summit last month. A statement issued after a weekly cabinet meeting quoted Gbagbo as promising “that by July 15 he would take the necessary measures to pass laws that must be adopted in order to end the crisis.” Previous efforts to disarm Cote d’Ivoire’s foes have collapsed because of failure to adopt political reforms or because of sporadic violence. UN Human Rights Commissioner Louise Arbour on Friday travelled to the volatile west of the country where more than 100 people were hacked, shot or burned to death in tit-for-tat ethnic violence last month. Thursday's cabinet statement said that Gbagbo is sending 800 extra troops to the region, which he has placed under military rule. It said he would also boost the security presence in the main city Abidjan with 1,700 men tasked with improving law-and-order. Earlier this week, the UN Security Council warned the leaders of both sides in the conflict they would face individual UN Security Council sanctions should they fail to meet new deadlines for the completion of disarmament over the next six weeks. A November 2004 Security Council resolution threatens travel bans and asset freezes against individuals blocking the peace process. Under the terms of the latest peace agreement, reached in Pretoria, South Africa, on 29 June, rebel and army chiefs were to finalise on 7 July the details of a timeline to disarm 42,000 rebels who control northern Cote d’Ivoire. The Pretoria agreement, brokered by African Union mediator and South African President Thabo Mbeki, demanded that the rebels start handing in weapons to UN peacekeepers at special cantonment sites in the north by the end of July. It also called for pro-government militias operating in the loyalist south to begin disarming immediately and complete the process by 20 August. However, there have been no moves so far make the various armed groups controlling several thousand militiamen hand in their guns. Disarmament must be completed before the country, once held up as a beacon of prosperity in West Africa, can reunify and hold presidential elections. The polls are planned for 30 October, but work on drawing up an electoral register has barely started and diplomats have been warning for months that it will be difficult to organise credible elections in such a short timeframe. The civil war erupted in September 2002 and although a peace deal was agreed in principle four months later, international efforts to shepherd the divided West African nation towards peace have snagged repeatedly on the issue of disarmament. The Pretoria Two accord is only the latest in a string of attempts to put Cote d'Ivoire's flagging peace process back on track. Officials attending the talks in Yamoussoukro said the military chiefs, flanked by members of the UN Mission in Cote d’Ivoire (ONUCI), were also discussing ways of tightening security in the main southern city of Abidjan for rebel members of the country’s government of national reconciliation. Rebel ministers have failed to turn up at cabinet meetings in Abidjan since last October citing fears for their safety. Opposition politicians and members of the New Forces rebel movement hold half of the portfolios in the government chaired by independent Prime Minister Seydou Diarra."
Lingering crisis still threatens regional stability,"Cote d'Ivoire almost relapsed into all-out civil war during 2004, raising fears that a fresh outbreak of full-scale hostilities could undermine security and stunt economic growth in several neighbouring countries. As the year ended, the prospects for putting its faltering peace process back on the rails in time for elections to be held on schedule in October 2005 looked slim. During 2004 the country which was once the economic motor of the region, lurched from one major outbreak of violence to another. In March, at least 120 people were killed when government security forces smashed opposition attempts to stage a demonstration in the economic capital Abidjan in March. And 99 freshly interred bodies were found in mass graves after fighting broke out between rival rebel factions in the northern city of Korhogo in June. During the same month, President Laurent Gbagbo sent helicopter gunships to strafe a column of rebel vehicles near the frontline, killing 20 people. But the peace process nearly broke down completely in early November when Gbagbo's small air force bombed cities in the rebel-held north of Cote d'Ivoire for two days in a row as his army prepared to launch a ground offensive. That violation of an 18-month-old ceasefire was stopped in its tracks by French peacekeepers. They destroyed Gbagbo's fleet of jet bombers and helicopter gunships on the ground after nine of their colleagues were killed in an air raid on the rebel capital Bouake. Following this psychological blow, the columns of government troops that were preparing to push their way past UN peacekeepers maintaining a buffer zone along the frontline, turned round and returned to their barracks Mbeki tries to mediate President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa subsequently became the latest in a long line of mediators to try and resolve the conflict. He spent five days in Cote d'Ivoire in early December trying to persuade Gbagbo and the New Forces rebel movement to agree on a new timetable for political reform and disarmament that would allow presidential elections to take place on schedule, with all the country's main political leaders taking part. Mbeki was called in by the African Union after France, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the United Nations had all failed to push the peace process forward. But as the year drew to a close, there were no indications that his mediation efforts had achieved a significant breakthrough. The level of distrust between Gbagbo and the northern rebels was greater than ever, with rebel spokesmen proclaiming publicly that no peace deal would be possible so long as Gbagbo remained head of state. And the expatriate business community, which runs much of Cote d'Ivoire's cocoa-based economy, battened down the hatches in anticipation of further trouble ahead. Nearly 9,000 French residents and other European nationals fled Cote d'Ivoire in November after pro-Gbagbo mobs rampaged through Abidjan protesting at France's military intervention to halt the government offensive. The demonstrators, led by the hardline ""Young Patriots"" militia movement, torched French schools, looted the homes and businesses of many white residents and confronted French troops which took control of the airport and several other key locations. The government said 57 people were killed and more than 2,000 were injured in these clashes. Meanwhile, there were fears that a renewal of full-scale hostilities in Cote d'Ivoire could destabilise the UN-supervised peace processes in neighbouring Liberia and nearby Sierra Leone. Both countries are still nursing the wounds of bitter civil wars which destroyed their economies and ripped apart the fabric of society. Liberian factions disarm By the end of November, the UN peacekeeping force in Liberia had disarmed over 100,000 former combatants who claimed to have fought in the country's 14-year civil war. The blue helmets only managed to collect one gun for every four Liberians who stepped forward to claim the US$300 resettlement allowance paid to ex-fighters following the signing of a peace accord in August 2003. But the disarmament of Liberia's three warring factions and the deployment of 15,000 UN peacekeepers throughout the interior of the country encouraged over 600,000 refugees and internally displaced people to start returning to their abandoned villages. Liberia's shattered economy remained hamstrung by a UN ban on the export of timber and diamonds - which was extended into 2005. And with virtually no source of domestic revenue, the transitional government remained totally reliant on foreign aid to function. Rioting between Muslims and Christians in the capital Monrovia in late October led to the death of 29 people and showed that the security situation was still fragile. A curfew was imposed for several days afterwards. However, in December, Liberia's interim parliament finally passed long-delayed legislation that paved the way for presidential and parliamentary elections to be held in October 2005. Sierra Leone, which emerged from 10 years of civil war at the end of 2001, remained peaceful throughout the year. Relief agencies celebrated the success of a drive to resettle those displaced by the conflict. Most are now back in their villages growing their own food once more. A war crimes trial finally got under way at the UN-backed Special Court in Freetown in June. But many of those deemed to bear the greatest responsibility for the appalling atrocities committed were either dead or absent from the courtroom. Former rebel leader Foday Sankoh died in custody awaiting trial and his military commander, Sam Bockerie, was cut down by a hail of bullets in Liberia. Former Liberian president Charles Taylor, who was accused of backing their Revolutionary United Front (RUF), continued to enjoy political asylum in Nigeria. And Johnny Paul Koroma, the leader of a military junta which once tried to make common cause with the rebels, was in hiding. Uncomfortably for the government, that left Sam Hinga Norman, the former defence minister of elected President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, as the highest ranking warlord on trial. Diplomats and foreign aid workers expressed concern at crippling levels of corruption in Tejan Kabbah's government and voiced doubts about the ability of his British-trained army to maintain security and support the democratic process. The UN Security Council decided to prolong the mandate of a scaled-down UN peacekeeping force of 3,500 men until June 2005 as a precautionary measure. An even bigger worry for diplomats in the region was that Guinea could become the next country to be drawn into the vortex of confict. Fragile stability in Guinea Guinea has so far remained quiet as a result of draconian security measures imposed by President Lansana Conte. But the country's economy, based on foreign exchange income from bauxite exports, is in ruins. Public services such as electricity, water, education and healthcare barely function. And the meagre living standards of Guinea's eight million people have fallen further as food prices have soared. Meanwhile ethnic tensions bubble away beneath the surface. Conte is a former army colonel who has ruled the country with an iron hand for 20 years, but he appears to be increasingly ill with diabetes - he can no longer walk unassisted - and he has no obvious successor Diplomats are concerned that an outburst of popular discontent, such as when food riots swept the capital Conakry in June, could plunge the country into chaos. Student unrest led to the closure of the country's main university in the capital Conakry in mid-December. Diplomats also fear an overspill of the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire into the volatile Forest Region of eastern Guinea. This is already a social powder keg. About 100,000 Guinean migrants to Cote d'Ivoire fled to seek refuge in the Forest Region following the outbreak of the Ivorian civil war in September 2003. Idle former fighters from Liberia's Mandingo ethnic group roam the countryside, mingling with Liberian refugees and siding with their Guinean kinsmen whenever ethnic clashes break out. And the remnants of a pro-Conte militia group which was created four years ago to repel incursions from Liberia, still bear arms. Running out of patience with Cote d'Ivoire But the most immediate concern of diplomats and aid workers is Cote d'Ivoire itself. As 2004 drew to a close, there were several indications that the international community was running out of patience with the continuing impasse in the country's peace process and was preparing to toughen its attitude towards the warring parties. Following the renewed outbreak of hostilities in early November, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan urged the Security Council to send more than 1,200 extra troops and a contingent of attack helicopters to Cote d'Ivoire to beef up the 6,000-strong UN peacekeeping force already in the country. There was no immediate response to this. However, the Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Cote d'Ivoire and agreed to keep alive the threat of further sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes on leading personalities. On 24 December, a so far unpublished UN report on human rights abuses committed during Cote d'Ivoire's two-year-old civil war was leaked to the French daily newspaper Liberation. The Parisian daily quoted this document as saying that some of the most serious abuses committed by both the government and rebels amounted to crimes against humanity. It also reported that a secret annex to the report listed the names of 200 individuals who could face prosecution or UN sanctions. Earlier in the year other UN reports on human rights abuse in Cote d'Ivoire were also leaked to the media before their official publication. Diplomats said there was little doubt that the document published by Liberation represented an accurate picture of the findings of the UN human rights investigators. Indeed, the report may have been leaked deliberately to put pressure on both government and rebel leaders to accept the Mbeki peace plan. A UN source confirmed to Reuters news agency that the blacklist of about 200 names existed and could well be used as a basis for punitive action against key individuals. A summit of the AU Peace and Security Commission was to be held in Addis Ababa on 10 January to review the progress achieved by Mbeki. The UN Security Council was due to review the imposition of further sanctions on Cote d'Ivoire at about the same time. Mbeki's road map to a political settlement is still the French-brokered Linas-Marcoussis accord, agreed by the parties to the conflict in January 2003. It is only the deadlines for implementing various key points of the deal have changed. The Marcoussis deal was only accepted grudgingly by Gbagbo. He has consistently complained that it grants too many concessions to the rebels. Stalling by his Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) party led to endless delays in legislating the political reforms called for by the peace agreement. By the end of December, all the Marcoussis reforms had been approved by parliament. But a political row continued to simmer over whether a constitutional ammendment endorsed by the legislature should be put to a referendum as well. Ggagbo continued to insist on a referendum to approve the change which would allow Alassane Ouattara, a former prime minister who is popular in the north, to stand against him in the 2005 presidential elections. Ouattara, who lives in exile in Paris, was banned from taking part in the 2000 presidential election which brought Gbagbo to power on the disputed grounds that his father was born in Burkina Faso. So long as the political reforms promised by Marcoussis were not on the statute book, the rebels refused to hand in their weapons, but this justification for retaining their guns has been largely removed. However, given Gbagbo's attempt to resume war in November, the rebels may well seek additional guarantees from the international community before agreeing to disarm. Meanwhile, a question mark has arisen over the future role of France's 5,000 troops in Cote d'Ivoire. These work alongside the UN peacekeeping force under independent command with a specific mandate to intervene quickly in trouble spots. Since the French intervened to destroy Gbagbo's air force on 6 November, they are no longer viewed by the president and his supporters as a neutral force in the conflict. Rowdy street demonstrations by Gbagbo's supporters have urged them to leave. However, French troops prevented the rebels from marching on Abidjan when the civil war first erupted in September 2003 and Gbagbo himself has so far stopped short of demanding their withdrawal. Poverty rises in a poisoned atmosphere Within Cote d'Ivoire, the political atmosphere remained poisonous at the year end, offering little prospect for the early return of more than 500,000 migrant workers and their families who have fled back to Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea. They left to escape persecution by Gbagbo's supporters who regard them as rebel sympathisers. Most immigrants from other West African countries have stayed on, but they and people from the north of Cote d'Ivoire remain a favourite target for extortion by government soldiers and policemen at road blocks. Pro-Gbagbo newspapers continue to stir up distrust and hatred of foreigners. Such ethnic tensions, stoked by land ownership disputes, occasionally lead to orgies of blood-letting. Just before Christmas 18 people were reported killed near the southern town of Gagnoa when Burkinabe settlers who had been driven off their farms by members of Gbagbo's Bete ethnic group attacked a village near the president's own home. The army said 11 people died in the raid and the Burkinabe consul in Gagnoa reported that seven Burkinabes were subsequently shot or hacked to death in reprisal killings. Conditions are no better in the rebel-held north, where most schools and hospitals have remained closed for the past two years, those who disagree with the rebels are forced to remain silent and many farmers who once grew cash crops have reverted to subsistence farming. This year's harvest in the north has been poor and as the rebels grow short of funds there have been regular reports of rebel gunmen extorting money from villagers. Indeed, although Cote d'Ivoire was once the most prosperous country in West Africa, unemployment and poverty are on the increase on both sides of the front line and immigrants' remittances to neighbouring countries have fallen sharply. The United Nations estimated in December that 44 percent of Cote d'Ivoire's 16 million population lived below the poverty line - up from 38 percent in 2002 - and that the need for humanitarian aid would rise further in 2005."
Security Council urges adherence to peace deal,"A UN Security Council mission left Cote d’Ivoire’s economic capital, Abidjan, on Wednesday, promising to hold to account key players who did not adhere to a peace deal signed in January 2003. “We will hold accountable everyone here for their contribution, those who contribute positively, and indeed those who seek to obstruct [peace],” said Sir Emyr Jones Parry, head of the mission. “Those who wish to obstruct should not assume that it will be business as usual,” warned Parry, who is Britain’s permanent representative to the United Nations. Diplomatic sources who declined to be named told IRIN on Thursday that the Security Council was considering levying sanctions against Cote d’Ivoire. Sanctions would likely target the guilty parties, and not the entire Ivorian population, they said, adding that all political actors, including President Laurent Gbagbo, opposition leaders and the rebels, could be targeted. Cote d’Ivoire, once a model of stability in West Africa, was rocked by a coup d’etat in 1999. Less than three years later, in September 2002, a failed uprising in Abidjan developed into a rebellion that divided the country. The rebels, known as the New Forces, continue to occupy the north while the government holds the south. An accord signed in January 2003 in Marcoussis, France, paved the way for a power-sharing government including parties loyal to the president, opposition groups and rebels. In March 2004, however, opposition and New Forces ministers walked out of the government after more than 100 of their supporters were killed by security forces and pro-Gbagbo militias as they tried to stage a demonstration for peace. In May, Gbagbo responded to the boycott by sacking three opposition ministers, including New Forces leader Guillaume Soro. The Security Council mission, representing 14 of the 15 Security Council members, arrived in Cote d'Ivoire on Tuesday from Ghana, where it began an eight-day West African tour to promote ""coherent policy-making"" in a region wracked by more than a decade of war. Speaking to the press in Abidjan on Wednesday, just before the mission left for Liberia, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, France’s ambassador to the UN, called on all sides to adhere to the terms of the Marcoussis Agreement. “The Security Council expects all parties in Cote d’Ivoire to respect the engagements they have undertaken,"" he said at the press conference, which followed meetings with President Laurent Gbabgo and Prime Minister Seydou Diarra. “We repeated the aim, which I think is shared by the president, to allow free, open and transparent elections in October 2005. Marcoussis is the way to do this,"" de la Sabliere said. The Security Council mandated a UN peacekeeping force of more than 6,000 for Cote d’Ivoire, the country's first, in March."
Security Council mission warns of sanctions against armed groups,"A UN Security Council mission arrived in Uganda on Wednesday and told reporters that the UN would increase pressure on illegal armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). ""Sanctions will be imposed against armed groups that refuse to disarm,"" said the head of the mission, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, who is also the French ambassador to the UN. The mission began a 10-day tour of the Great Lakes region on Saturday with stops in the DRC, Burundi, before Uganda and Rwanda, and finally Tanzania. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in Entebbe, de La Sablière said was important that the Congolese army now ""engage in more robust action with the support of [the UN Mission in the DRC] MONUC to deal with the situation in eastern DRC"". Thousands of rebels from Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda operate from eastern DRC. In Burundi on Tuesday, de La Sablière said that the Security Council might also take punitive action against the Burundian Forces nationales de liberation (FNL) rebels in eastern DRC. ""Burundians are right to worry that the FNL issue is lasting too long,"" he said. ""[The FNL] had better negotiate with the government or else sanctions can be imposed."" De La Sablière also told reporters that the number of UN peacekeeping troops in Burundi might soon be reduced. Government spokesman Karenga Ramazani said on Tuesday that the Burundi government had asked the UN to place more emphasis on reconstruction and development than on peacekeeping. ""It seems that the delegation understands our wishes,"" he said. However, Karenga said the UN should expand MONUC's mandate in DRC and increase its troop strength in the border area with Burundi to prevent the FNL from launching raids on their homeland. ""We are studying the issue of the mandate of MONUC,"" de La Sablière said on Wednesday in Uganda."
Nation gets US $75 million in new World Bank grants,"The World Bank approved a US $55-million grant on Thursday to assist economic reform and improve social services in Rwanda as well as another grant of $20 million to support the government's urban management efforts. ""At project completion, Rwanda should see a marked increase in the number of children attending or completing primary school and see a significant drop in the number of under-five mortality and the spread of communicable diseases,"" the World Bank said in a statement on its US $55-million grant known as the 'Second Poverty Reduction Support Grant'. Both that and the grant for urban infrastructure will be issued by the Bank's International Development Association. The World Bank task team leader for the urban infrastructure project, Sylvie Debomy, said on Thursday: ""The provision of adequate infrastructure and services to cities will enable them to strengthen urban-rural linkages and ensure that they play a more active role as market-cities for the surrounding rural areas."" Some of the money for the poverty reduction support will in part be used for education, health, energy sectors and water. The poverty reduction support grant will help improve water management ""through private operators, help the country to continue to improve donor coordination in the sector, and focus on the approval and implementation of a new water law"". This grant will also be used to help create a strong basis for private sector-led economic growth, driven by agricultural transformation, promotion of exports. Currently Rwanda's main export is coffee. The World Bank said the grant would assist the government in ""creating a strong basis for private sector-led economic growth, driven by agricultural transformation, promotion of exports, and a deepening of reform in the financial sector"". ""The government of Rwanda has made good progress in strengthening management of public finances,"" The World Bank said, adding that it would also be used to help strengthen governance and transparency through further improvements to the fiduciary framework. ""It will also help empower local communities,"" it said."
Security Council urges Museveni to end conflict in north,"Members of the UN Security Council on Thursday urged Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni to end an 18-year conflict, which has caused a major humanitarian crisis in the country's northern districts. ""We had a meeting with President Museveni and our message to Uganda was that the humanitarian crisis in the north should be settled as soon as possible,"" Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, France's ambassador to the UN, told reporters at Entebbe airport at the end of the Council's six-day visit to the Great Lakes region. Northern Uganda has been ravaged by nearly two decades of an insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The rebel group is notorious for its atrocities against civilians, including the kidnapping of thousands of children for conscription into its ranks and forcing others to become sex slaves for its commanders. The conflict has displaced an estimated 1.6 million people. ""The president [Museveni] told us that there were good prospects for peace in Uganda,"" said De la Sabliere. ""All the international community and Council are concerned with is what is taking place in northern Uganda,"" De la Sabliere added. ""We are concerned about the situation of child soldiers - it is not only to condemn the situation, but we need to find a solution."" A seven-day truce announced by Museveni on 14 November, after the LRA guerrillas expressed willingness to start peace talks, expired on Monday. But a government spokesman told IRIN on Friday that the ceasefire had been extended by another week. ""The extension will count from the date the first ceasefire expired - it was decided to give the extension to show that the government was entirely committed to the peaceful resolution of the conflict,"" Information Minister, Nsaba Buturo, said. He said rebels were responding to the state's decision to temporarily suspend military operations against them. The Council said it had not discussed the civil strife in northern Uganda in detail during the meeting with Museveni, adding that talks had centred on the peace process in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Ugandan leader has been involved in efforts to end civil war in Burundi and Uganda, and at one time, was involved in the conflict in the DRC. ""We encouraged the DRC people to do their best to accelerate efforts to set up an integrated army and police,"" said De la Sabliere. ""We think that the stability of the Ituri and Kivu regions is important to hold elections and we have discussed this with president Museveni."" Non-governmental organisations working in northern Uganda criticised what they said was the Council's failure to address the crisis there. ""Here is another wasted opportunity to bring a just and lasting peace to the people of Uganda"", said Stella Ayo Odongo, the chairperson of the Civil Society Organisations for Peace in Northern Uganda (CSOPNU). ""As the Council members relax in their hotel tonight [Thursday], thousands of children will be walking miles from their villages to towns like Kitgum in order to sleep in the open - the only way they can be safe from attacks,"" CSOPNU said in a statement after the Council's meeting with Museveni."
Government criticises Security Council resolution,"The Eritrean government has sharply criticised the latest UN Security Council resolution on the border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, describing it as ""deplorable"" and ""lopsided"". ""The Security Council has adopted another deplorable resolution on the border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia,"" said a statement issued on Thursday by the Eritrean Foreign Ministry in the capital, Asmara. ""This lopsided resolution underscores one glaring fact: it is not international law and the Charter of the United Nations that govern the conduct of the Security Council but sheer power politics and the narrow interests of major powers,"" it added. The statement listed several cases of alleged violations of the Algiers peace agreement by Ethiopia. The Council had, in a unanimously adopted resolution on Wednesday, threatened to take action, including sanctions, against Ethiopia and Eritrea if the two neighbours continued to engage in activities that aggravated their ongoing border dispute. It deplored Eritrea's restrictions on the freedom of movement of the UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) and demanded that Asmara immediately reverse its 5 October decision to ban UNMEE helicopter flights. Noting the high concentration of troops on both sides of the Temporary Security Zone, the Council called on the two nations to refrain from any threat or use of force against each other and to immediately return to the 16 December 2004 deployment levels. The Eritrean government maintained, however, that Ethiopia had violated the peace agreement and the UN Charter in July 2002 by establishing unlawful settlements in the sovereign Eritrean territory of Dembe Mengul. ""This gross breach of the agreement was fully ascertained by an independent fact-finding mission,"" it noted, adding that the report of the mission was submitted to the Security Council, which passed a resolution asking Ethiopia to dismantle the settlements within 30 days. ""In what was to become a predictable pattern, Ethiopia refused to comply with the terms of Resolution 1430 while the Security Council failed to take remedial action,"" it said. In its resolution on Wednesday, the Council urged the two nations to break the stalemate on the implementation of the peace agreement through diplomatic efforts and asked the Secretary-General to monitor the parties' compliance with its demands and submit a report within 40 days. The Council demanded that Ethiopia accept fully and without further delay the binding decision of the boundary commission and immediately take concrete steps to enable, without preconditions, the commission to demarcate the border completely and promptly. UNMEE has estimated that Eritrea's ban on helicopter flights had cut its capacity to monitor the buffer zone between the two countries by more than half. Almost all night patrols were curtailed and restrictions placed on vehicle and foot patrols."
Interview with World Bank head,"Faris Hadad-Zervos, head of mission of the World Bank for Iraq, says the focus of the US $400 million interim strategy will be training and capacity building as well as emergency projects. In an interview with IRIN in the Jordanian capital, Amman, he outlined expectations and goals to be reached within a nine-month period. QUESTION: When did the World Bank start its work on Iraq? ANSWER: Actually, Iraq is a founding member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. We spent most of last year on this project. I spent time getting economic information in 11 of the 14 sectors we plan to operate in, which was presented at the Madrid [donor] conference. In the summary, we said Iraq has US $55 billion in needs of which $35 billion is to come from the bank, $20 billion from the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to be spent from 2004-2007. We opened this office in December. Q: What is the World Bank strategy in Iraq? A: We have an interim strategy of six to nine months that we presented in December. It covers the time period between July-September. In the interim period of six to nine months, we want to do three things: capacity building and training; emergency projects of reconstruction and rehabilitation; and to support policy for medium-term reforms. Q: How much is allocated for the interim strategy? A: We have $400 million. The donors at Abu Dhabi committed to that number, and it's coming in. Of that, we will spend $100 million on emergency education infrastructure, mainly on new textbooks. Another $200 million will be spent on urban infrastructure rehabilitation projects done in coordination with the Ministry of Public Works and Municipalities. That will cover things like power, transportation and possibly telecommunications in cities. Water supplies and sanitation systems will also be a big part of the project. Then we'll spend another $100 million on emergency infrastructure in rural areas. We'll start with labour intensive infrastructure - water and sanitation. We expect to appraise these projects by the end of this month with the help of local consultants we recruited. We are working with several Jordanian firms with Iraqi subsidiaries. We also have an office here that spearheads that type of work. Q: What type of training will be carried out? A: In terms of training, we have already started a three-month training for 75 Iraqis who represent a cross-section of Iraqis working in procurement, financial management and project implementation. We don't implement projects. We set them up, then we have the Iraqis implement them. Actually, they [Iraqis] know how to do that, but we, the bank, the United Nations, the donor community, have a certain way of doing things, so it's them adapting to meet the needs of the donor community. We're doing workshops with the education and telecommunications sectors and more on private development and state-owned enterprises. So in terms of workshops we are going full steam ahead. Q: How do you expect the economy to function in post-war Iraq? A: One of the issues is finding a proper mechanism to track purchasing power. We're waiting to hear what the Iraqis want to do in the market, letting the market guide things, letting the private sector guide things, still with an important role for the public sector [which] is the most sustainable way for the economy to function. A plan has to take into account the pains people will go through if the economy transitions too quickly, but you need a sustainable system for the long term. We want to ultimately move to a system that relies on market forces but not at the price of suffering to vulnerable groups. Q: How will this work? A: In a market economy, the bank needs to look at the investment climate, including laws and regulations, and what the private sector is doing. We've been in discussions with the CPA and the Ministries of Finance and Planning about private sector development and price liberalisation. To what extent do you keep subsidies and to what extent to you remove them? You have to make sure any move you make, whether a public distribution system [an estimated 60 percent of Iraqi families are completely dependent on a food basket distributed monthly under the former United Nations Oil-For-Food programme now run mostly by the Ministry of Trade] or a cash payment, actually works. Q: Who will make sure the transition goes smoothly? A: Iraqi government ministries have some good technical competencies. Our relationships with them are growing. The Ministries of Education, Health and Public Works have been handed back to Iraqis. We are on course with them, and our expectations have been met. But the bank is not making decisions as to what reforms are taking place and speed at which they are taking place. We're sharing with them the experience and lessons from what we know. Q: What's going to happen at the status conference in Qatar in May? A: The conference will assess the progress of programmes. It's important, because it gives the donors a chance to assess what's going on. Q: How does the security situation affect your work? A: It's a myth that we have an option to start reconstruction in Iraq. We have to start the reconstruction. But it's no secret, especially in the last week, that it has been very precarious. We'll have to wait and see what happens. We're taking things as they come. It sounds like it's just a phrase, but if you get lemons, you have to make lemonade. Q: What are your predictions for Iraq? A: We see some basic indicators going in a positive direction - GDP [gross domestic product] has been growing, for example. Unemployment has been a huge problem and will continue to be a huge problem, but there is business activity. And the dinar has held steady at about 1,400 to the US dollar. It's holding its own, so somebody has faith there. The picture is not 100 percent rosy, but there are good signs. There are some things moving despite the security problems."
Security Council warns obstructionist leaders,"The UN Security Council has called on Somali parties taking part in peace talks in Kenya to ""reach a peaceful settlement"", and warned those blocking progress that it will keep a close watch. In a statement to the press following consultations on Wednesday, the current Council president, Ambassador Wang Guangya of China, warned that ""the Security Council condemns those who obstruct the peace process, and stresses that those who persist on the path of confrontation and conflict will be held accountable"". The Council called on Somalis to build on the progress made at the peace talks currently under way in Kenya under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, in order to establish ""a viable transitional government"". The Security Council also expressed concern over ""the continued flow of weapons and ammunition"" into Somalia, calling on all ""states and entities"" to cooperate with the monitoring group which oversees the arms embargo. A four-member panel of experts to investigate violations of the arms embargo on Somalia and advise the Council's sanctions committee was appointed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in September 2002."
UN Security Council condemns those who obstruct peace process,"The UN Security Council has condemned those who, it says, are obstructing Somalia's peace process, and warned that anyone persisting on the path of confrontation and conflict will be held accountable. In a statement read out on Wednesday at an open meeting by its president for July, Ambassador Mihnea Ioan Motoc of Romania, the Security Council also welcomed steps by the African Union to prepare for the deployment of military monitors to Somalia, and called on the Somali leaders to cooperate with that initiative. The statement called on the Somali parties to respect a cessation of hostilities agreement signed between various rival groups in the Kenyan town of Eldoret in 2002, according to UN News. It also urged Somali factions to ensure security and to resolve their differences peacefully. ""The Council recognises that while the establishment of a transitional federal government will be an important step towards establishing sustainable peace and stability in Somalia, much effort will lie ahead if this objective is to be achieved,"" Motoc said. In a series of related provisions, the Council reiterated its firm support for the reconciliation process and the ongoing Somali National Reconstruction Conference in Kenya, launched under the auspices of the regional African Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD). The Council expressed concern over the continuing flow of weapons and ammunition into the country and over the humanitarian situation in Somalia. It called on Somali leaders to facilitate the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance and to assure the safety of all international and national aid workers. On 8 July, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged Somali delegates attending the reconciliation conference to resolve their divergences and create an all-inclusive government. ""I appeal to you to rise above your differences, and do all you can to bring your people an era of security, peace and hope,"" Annan told the delegates when he addressed them in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. On 23 June, the delegates formed an arbitration committee to resolve any disputes that might arise during the nomination of the 275 members of Somalia's proposed Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). Various clan representatives at the reconciliation conference are currently in the process of nominating TFP members, but the process has been slowed down by disputes. Bethuel Kiplagat, the chief mediator in the Somali peace process, said on Tuesday that the IGAD Facilitation Committee was working to remove all bottlenecks in the distribution of parliamentary seats among subclans. Mediators have urged the delegates to honour a 31 July 2004 deadline set by IGAD for the end of Phase III, the last stage of the peace talks. Somalia has been without a functioning government since the toppling in 1991 of the regime of Muhammad Siyad Barre. The IGAD-sponsored talks began in October 2002 in Eldoret and were moved to Nairobi in February 2003."
Security Council re-affirms full support for peace process,"The UN Security Council on Friday re-affirmed its full support for the peace process in Somalia and the UN's commitment to help regional and sub-regional organisations working to restore stability in the Horn-of-Africa country, which has lacked an effective government for more than a decade. ""The Council welcomes the progress made in the Somalia national reconciliation process - in particular the establishment of the Transitional Federal Parliament, the election of the speaker of the parliament, the president and the appointment of the prime minister, which provides a sound and solid framework to achieve a comprehensive and lasting solution to the situation,"" the Council said in a statement adopted on the last day of a two-day meeting in Nairobi. ""The Council reiterates its expectation of the establishment of a broad-based, all-inclusive and effective government inside Somalia that will continue the reconciliation efforts with all Somali parties,"" it added. The Council further emphasized its ""respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and unity of Somalia, consistent with the purposes and principles of the charter of the UN"". In response to a question from a member of the Council, Somalia's Prime Minister Ali Muhammad Gedi said his government would move from Nairobi to Mogadishu by January, at the latest. ""My government will not remain a government in exile,"" said the prime minister. He added that he planned to send members of a yet-to-be-named cabinet and members of parliament on a fact-finding mission to all parts of the country, following which, the government will be installed inside Somalia. Addressing the Council, Somalia's President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed said his government was ""working on the twin objectives of consolidating reconciliation talks with armed groups and realizing a tangible peace-building plan"". Yusuf said the deployment of 15,000-20,000 troops, which he has urged the African Union (AU) to provide, should not be seen as an attempt to impose the government's will upon the people by force. Parliamentary approval would be sought before AU forces are sent to Somalia, he added. He said that a 20,000-30,000 National Security Force (police and army) would be recruited, trained and equipped to take over from the peacekeeping forces ""at the appropriate time"". ""The Somali government requests the assistance of the international community in sustaining reconciliation and reconstruction in the whole country,"" Yusuf said. The Council stressed that it was the responsibility of all Somali parties to work together to consolidate the gains made so far in the country's reconciliation process. ""The Council encourages a dialogue between the international-donor community and the future transitional federal government on the principles and modalities of international coordination under discussion, including the Stockholm meeting of 29 October, and welcomes the UN-led, facilitating role in that dialogue and in subsequent coordination of arrangements,"" it said in the statement. The Council commended the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the government of Kenya and other countries and organisations for facilitating the Somali peace process. It expressed its support for the AU's commitment to assist the transitional process in Somalia and ""in particular, the planning for a mission in Somalia, including options for disarmament, demobilization and re-integration"". Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki earlier urged the international community to help Somalia's fledgling government restore law and order in the country. ""There is no denying that without a central authority, Somalia poses a risk to its neighbours,"" Kibaki said in his address to the Council on 18 November. ""There is no way of monitoring movement of illicit arms, which have infiltrated our borders and are the cause of the rise in the incidence of violent crimes in our cities. But more importantly, Somalia - without a government - is likely to be a haven for dangerous criminals with terrorist intentions."" Speaking in his capacity as the current chairman of IGAD, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni also urged the international community to back the new authorities in Somalia to restore normalcy in that country. ""IGAD, the AU, the Arab People and the UN should, materially and technically, back this government so that it establishes its authority in Somalia within the shortest time possible,"" said Museveni."
South African trade unionists deported,"The Zimbabwean government on Tuesday deported a 14-member South African Congress of Trade Unions (COSATU) delegation on a fact-finding visit to the country. The COSATU team arrived in Zimbabwe on Monday on a four-day mission, after the government warned they would not be welcome, but were eventually allowed into the country. The police, intelligence services and immigration officers rounded up the delegates on Tuesday as they held a meeting with their counterparts from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions at a hotel in central Harare, the capital. The head of the COSATU delegation, Violet Seboni, condemned their extradition. ""This is absolutely crazy, but we are not angry or surprised. This confirms to the world what we have always said, that there is no rule of law and that democratic space is being closed. Only one side of the Zimbabwean story has been told, but everybody can now see the levels of intolerance."" Immigration officials told IRIN that the cabinet had resolved to deport the South Africans after they refused to give guarantees that they would not meet members of civic society accused by the authorities of being anti-government. COSATU international relations secretary Simon Boshiel told IRIN: ""Immigration officials and members of the police wanted us to give a guarantee that we would not meet with Crisis Coalition of Zimbabwe [CCZ], National Constitutional Assembly [NCA] and the Zimbabwe Council of Churches [ZCC]. We could not give them the guarantee because ... we did not understand why this was necessary."" The CCZ groups together labour, churches, opposition political parties, media, civic and human rights groups working for a negotiated solution to Zimbabwe's economic and political crisis. The NCA is an alliance of several organisations campaigning for a new ""democratic"" constitution, while the ZCC is the biggest representative body of churches in the country. The NCA was quick to condemn the deportation of the trade unionists. ""What makes the action even more deplorable is that the COSATU delegation had not committed any offence in Zimbabwe,"" said NCA spokesperson Jessie Majome."

World Bank announces aid to government,"The World Bank on Monday signed two grants totaling US $35 million with the Nepalese government for the development of rural road infrastructure and economic reform. Under the terms of the agreement, $32 million will be financed to rehabilitate and upgrade over 4,500 km of rural roads, trails and tracks in 20 districts, as well in the construction of some 350 suspension trail bridges, which are often the only means of access to market areas and services. The grant would also include the maintenance of those bridges and trails destroyed by the Maoist rebels, who have been fighting a nine year insurgency against the government. An estimated 36 percent of Nepal’s 24 million people live at least two hours walk from the nearest all-season road where public transport services may be available, while more than 15 of the 75 district headquarters are still not connected by road. Sixty percent of the road network in the country and almost all rural roads are dry-season tracks that cannot be used during the rainy season, according to the World Bank. ""The lack of access is more severe in hill districts,"" a Bank statement said. ""Agriculture is the mainstay of the Nepali economy and accounts for 85 percent of employment. One of the major constraints hampering the development of the sector is the low-level of access to markets and services due to poor road infrastructure in remote areas,"" Binyam Reja, a transport economist with the World Bank, explained. The Bank said that poor infrastructure was one of the main constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction and also affected other key areas like health and education. ""Access to services and economic opportunities has been among the top casualties of Nepal’s ongoing conflict, especially in the remote rural hinterlands,"" Rajib Upadhyaya of the Bank told IRIN in the capital Kathmandu. Meanwhile, various socioeconomic surveys in Nepal also show that children in remote districts are more likely to be malnourished, die before they reach five years of age, or are less likely to attend school than children living in districts that are more accessible. The government’s Rural Access Improvement and Decentralisation Project (RAIDP) aims to generate a 20 percent increase in motorised and non- motorised trips by beneficiaries to key social and economic centres, while at the same time reducing travel time by 20 percent. At a time when several key aid agencies have not agreed to sign any new project agreements with the government, the World Bank’s grant has brought a sigh of relief to the government. ""The World Bank believes that these two new projects are consistent with the innovative development approach Nepal has pursued in the last few years and hence it believes that providing financial support to them is appropriate,"" said Ken Ohashi, World Bank country director for Nepal, in a statement released after the signing. ""Whether the Bank can continue to provide strong financial support in the coming months will depend heavily on the demonstration of political leadership in reinvigorating the pace of reform,"" he asserted. The Bank has stressed that financial assistance to the Himalayan kingdom would continue but could be affected if the government failed in achieving economic reforms and implementation of development activities. ""For Nepal to achieve faster economic growth and poverty reduction, it is absolutely necessary to resolve the conflict and to restore political stability. This, however, is likely to take time,"" Ohashi said. But the Bank also believes that despite the ongoing armed Maoist rebellion, the country has been able to develop various innovative ways to continue development activities - mostly through community and user group participation. Nearly $3 million will be financed on the country’s comprehensive reform agenda, which includes strengthening home-grown reform efforts in areas of public sector capacity, social inclusion and governance among others. With this grant, the Bank said that it was trying to help the government implement innovative and indigenous solutions to the country’s problems, using qualified Nepalese from the public and private sectors, as well as the diaspora, wherever possible. ""Key policymakers in Nepal are keenly aware that these improvements are central to promoting social equity and building lasting peace,"" Upadhyaya noted. ""This is reflected in Nepal’s Poverty Reduction Strategy and has formed the foundation for strong internal pressures to reform,"" he added."
World Bank urges leaders on values,"African governance has been ""polluted by western intrusion,"" James Wolfensohn, the head of the World Bank, said on Friday. Speaking at the United Nations African Development Forum in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, he told politicians and delegates they must tap their own traditional systems and values. ""Before colonialism it is clear that this continent had a remarkable concept of management,"" Wolfensohn said. ""There was long before colonialism a sense of values, a sense of sharing, a sense of community and a sense of participation."" He added: ""It was a system of people coming together for a common purpose. Now we have to find our way back. Governance is not something that is strange to Africa, it is something that has to be rediscovered in Africa."" In a wide-ranging speech, Wolfensohn told the week-long conference focusing on governance that the world's attention had been diverted to issues of terrorism and Iraq. He said the ""shadow of Iraq, the shadow of terrorism, the shadow of political uncertainty"" posed major hurdles to growth in Africa. ""The impact of this is important because it has diverted the attention of the world to questions of military expenditure as distinct from development,"" Wolfensohn noted. ""The single statistic that tells it all is that in this last year the world spent US $900 billion on military expenditure and $50 to $60 billion only on development. As we come to Africa we come to the recognition that the largest problem on the fundamental issue that we all need to face is the issue of equity and poverty. If we do not address [it] then there is no chance of peace,"" he said. ""If the fight against poverty is won it will remove the fundamental base from the problems of injustice and the problems of terror,"" Wolfensohn added. He noted that Africa was the ""most vulnerable"" continent with regard to achieving the 2015 global anti-poverty targets known as the Millennium Development Goals. In Africa, Wolfensohn said, 314 million people now lived under the international poverty line of $1 a day, compared to 160 million in 1981. Africa's share of global GDP - which he said was $40 trillion - was just one percent at $400 billion, he added. Wolfensohn said that AIDS was the biggest threat to governance on the continent. ""You have to deal with the questions of AIDS because it is a challenge that would bring down any government,"" he said, adding that corruption, capacity building and legal and financial reforms were also key. ""All too many of the corrupt governments can be found in sub-Saharan Africa and this is a tragedy,"" he said. ""People lose their enthusiasm, they lose their sense of purpose if they find that the results of the nation's hard work is being distorted and going to the wrong places. This issue of corruption is the single worse cancer that there is,"" he concluded."
World Bank ready to help fund demobilisation,"The World Bank is expected to release US $33 million to demobilise former fighters from both sides of Angola's devastating civil war and reintegrate them into their communities, a World Bank official said on Tuesday. The funds will form part of the Angolan Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (ADRP), which will also get a $53 million lift from a multi-donor trust fund set up for demobilisation and reintegration activities in a total of nine African countries. Angola's 27-year conflict, which pitted rebel UNITA forces against the government army, FAA, ended in April 2002. Since then, the government and international organisations have stressed that disarming and resettling former soldiers is key to reducing poverty and improving security in peace-time. ""It is crucial to consolidate peace and demobilisation, and reintegrate ex-combatants. This is one of the Bank's main focuses right now,"" Lisa Maier, World Bank operations assistant responsible for the ADRP, told IRIN. The aim of the programme is to demobilise and resettle 105,000 UNITA soldiers and 33,000 former government combatants. The government has already spent $187 million of its own funds to demobilise 100,000 former UNITA soldiers and the new funds from the ADRP will focus on reintegration, Maier said. ""We are very satisfied that the government has already started to demobilise. It has taken the initiative, given that the money from the Bank and the multi-donor trust fund has not been disbursed yet,"" she noted. ""So far, there has been no demobilisation of FAA, but we expect that to start soon."" The main thrust of the programme will be to provide farming tools and training to former combatants returning to the provinces of Huambo, Huila, Bie, Benguela, Kwanza-Sul and Malanje. ""The reintegration will be predominantly agricultural, for example, the delivering of seeds, tools, fertilisers, as well as training and technical assistance,"" Maier said. ""The soldiers will also be involved in community work; involved in the reconstruction of essential infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads and bridges – all in their home communities,"" she added. The combatants will work alongside returning refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs), be given access to apprenticeships and on-the-job training in income-generating activities, and be taught about business management and micro-credit schemes. Apart from this economic reintegration, the ADRP will help soldiers to mingle socially by providing confidence-building training, information and counselling about HIV/AIDS and STDs, as well as conflict analysis and reconciliation activities. ""These should kick off at the end of February,"" Maier said. The release of funds was delayed while the World Bank and the Angolan authorities completed a tender process to find an operator for the project's financial management. ""World Bank projects have effectiveness conditions, and only when these conditions are met will the money flow. Because this is such a large-scale project, the World Bank needs a solid financial management procurement unit,"" Maier explained. The United States Agency for International Development also announced last week it would donate $54 million to bolster existing efforts to resettle and reintegrate thousands of ex-UNITA combatants. These funds, to be channelled through the NGO, Consortium of Development and Aid to Angola, are expected to assist some 150,000 families in the provinces of Benguela, Huambo, Bie, Huila and Kwanza-Sul. In addition, the United Nations Development Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the International Labour Organisation have already begun an emergency special project which has invested $5 million in assistance and agricultural support to around 50,000 ex-soldiers."
EU welcomes Security Council resolution on Darfur,"The European Union (EU) has welcomed last week's adoption by the United Nations Security Council of a resolution that warns Sudan of punitive measures, including sanctions, if it failed to protect civilians in the strife-torn western region of Darfur. ""The EU fully supports the appeal made by the Security Council on the government of Sudan to meet its obligations towards all Sudanese and the international community,"" said a declaration issued by the EU presidency in Brussels on Wednesday. ""The European Union joins the Security Council in deploring the recent cease-fire violations and stresses the urgency of ending the climate of impunity in Darfur by bringing to justice those responsible, including members of the popular defence forces and Janjawid militia."" The conflict in Darfur pits the Sudanese military and militias said to be allied to the government against rebels fighting to end alleged marginalisation and discrimination of Darfur residents by the state. The militias, locally known as Janjawid, have been accused of committing atrocities against civilians. The fighting, which erupted early last year, has displaced about 1.45 million people and sent another 200,000 fleeing across the border into Chad. The UN has described problems spawned by the fighting in Darfur as currently being the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The Council resolution noted that despite progress made by the Sudanese government in lifting administrative obstructions to the delivery of humanitarian relief in Darfur, Khartoum had not fully met its obligations outlined in an earlier resolution calling on the government to improve security and protect civilians. The Council requested the UN Secretary-General to rapidly establish an international commission of inquiry, which would immediately investigate reports of human rights violations in Darfur, and determine whether acts of genocide had been committed. The US has described atrocities against civilians there as genocide. ""The European Union attaches great importance to the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to immediately investigate all reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Darfur by all parties, to determine whether acts of genocide have occurred and to identify the perpetrators of such violations with a view to having them brought to justice,"" said the EU statement. The EU said it would continue to support efforts by the African Union (AU) to end the conflict in Darfur. The pan-African body has sent 310 Nigerian and Rwandan troops to Darfur, mandated to protect 185 AU observers there. The AU is also involved with peace talks between the Sudanese government and the two rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement. ""The European Union recognises the need for continued humanitarian assistance and will sustain its contributions in support of those affected by the conflict in Darfur,"" said the EU declaration. In a related development, Japan has said it would provide an additional US $15 million to fund UN efforts in Darfur. Canadian Foreign Minister Pierre Pettigrew also said on Wednesday that Ottawa would contribute $20 million to fund a strengthened AU mission in Darfur."
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to visit,"The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees will begin a two-day visit to Afghanistan on Tuesday. “High Commissioner Antonio Guterres, who took office in June, plans to travel first to Kabul, where he will meet President Hamid Karzai, other senior officials and UNHCR staff to discuss the repatriation and reintegration [of Afghan refugees] operation in the country,” Nader Farhad, spokesman for the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said on Monday. He added Guterres would also travel to the eastern city of Jalalabad, where he will visit recent returnees, UNHCR staff and local officials. Since 2002, more than 4.4 million Afghans have returned home from Pakistan and Iran, 3.5 million of them assisted by UNHCR, according to the UN refugee agency. “Guterres will also be briefed about longer-term prospects for Afghanistan's reconstruction, which are crucial for any successful return programme,” Farhad explained. More than 3 million Afghans remain outside their country, mainly in Pakistan and Iran. Guterres is scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on Thursday for a two-day visit that will include an inspection of UNHCR’s emergency assistance to victims of the devastating 8 Oct earthquake, as well as meetings with several senior Pakistani government officials."
World Bank AIDS millions approved,"Ghana has secured a US $20 million anti-AIDS loan from the International Development Association (IDA), a division of the World Bank that provides interest-free loans to impoverished countries. Bank officials said earlier this week that the credit was approved as a follow-up to the IDA-financed Ghana AIDS Response Fund project (GARFUND). ""The continued participation of the Bank in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Ghana is critical in achieving Ghana's objectives of reducing new HIV/AIDS/STI transmission and mitigating the impact of related morbidity and mortality"", said Laura Rose, the Bank's task team leader of GARFUND. According to Ghana's AIDS Commission, the nation's relatively low HIV prevalence rate of 3.4 percent had not declined, despite costly publicity and control measures."
World Bank chided on loans and grants,"Former Mozambican First Lady Graca Machel has urged the World Bank to help Kenya tackle HIV/AIDS by allocating grants instead of loans, the BBC reported on Monday. At a recent meeting with Kenya's National AIDS Control Council (NACC) in the capital, Nairobi, Machel said it was unfair to encumber the country with a loan when the money was intended for prolonging the lives of HIV-positive people. ""We have to bring them [the Bank] to their senses, as we are talking about human lives; negotiate with them, step on their toes,"" she instructed NACC members after the Bank had reportedly rejected Kenya's grant application and decided to advance loans instead. Machel warned that repaying the loans would burden future generations."
Security Council extends UNMIS mandate,"Following a recommendation by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan earlier this month, the UN Security Council extended on Friday the mandate of the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) for a further six months. The Council decided, through resolution 1627 (2005), to extend UNMIS' mandate until 24 March 2006, with the intention to ""renew it for further periods"". ""I would like to thank my Special Representative [Jan Pronk] for his tireless efforts, as well as United Nations staff involved in working to help bring peace to all quarters of Sudan,"" said Annan, who recommended the extension in his 12 September report on Sudan to the Council. The Council established UNMIS in March 2005 to support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed by the Sudanese government and the former rebels of the southern Sudan People's Liberation movement/Army in January in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The agreement ended a civil war between northern and southern Sudan that had lasted 21 years. The Council further requested Annan to report to it every three months on the implementation of UNMIS' mandate, including its work to reinforce the efforts of the African Union Mission in Sudan to foster peace in the strife-torn western region of Darfur. Resolving to be ""actively seized of the matter"", the Council acknowledged the commitments by troop-contributing countries in support of UNMIS and encouraged deployment in order for the mission to support the timely implementation of the peace accord. The 9 January agreement was signed by Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir and the late first vice president of Sudan and chairman of SPLM/A, John Garang; it attempts to encourage wealth- and power-sharing in the oil-rich nation. The agreement, which began a six-year transitional period in the country, details protocols on sharing legislative power and natural resources. After the transitional period, south Sudan will vote to decide whether to remain politically united with the north or separate from it. UNMIS' mandate also includes monitoring and verifying the ceasefire agreement, helping to set up the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme for ex-combatants as well as promoting national reconciliation and human rights."
World Bank grant for land reform,"Malawi is to benefit from a US $50 million World Bank credit to support fiscal reforms, as well as a ground-breaking grant of a further US $27 million for land reform. The Bank announced that the $50 million would be accessed as an International Development Association (IDA) loan, with a commitment fee of 0.5 percent, a service charge of 0.75 percent, and a maturity of 40 years, including a 10-year period of grace. ""The Fiscal Management and Accelerating Growth (FMAG) project aims to deepen the implementation of structural reforms and lay a basis for generating growth in the country. It will support the government's economic growth and poverty reduction agenda, and provide the balance of payment support needed to finance the fiscal framework and reduce the growth of domestic debt,"" the Bank said in a statement. Recent food shortages combined with low economic growth had negatively impacted on the government's poverty reduction agenda. ""The FMAG credit will support the government's overall development strategy and help to sustain growth in the country,"" the Bank noted. The proposed credit would also support a set of specific structural reforms in fiscal management, agriculture and HIV/AIDS projects. ""Reforms in fiscal management will help strengthen the government's capacity to meet macroeconomic stabilisation targets, protect pro-poor expenditures, and improve the delivery of social services through accelerating fiscal decentralisation. The statements of expenses reforms will help reduce the burden on the budget and improve the delivery of key infrastructure services,"" the Bank explained. The project would also contribute to growth by increasing the returns to smallholder farmers, and support land policy reforms that would increase access to land and ensure it was used more equitably. A national HIV/AIDS commission would help channel resources and strengthen institutions to mitigate the health and social impact of the pandemic. ""On the whole, the project is designed to improve the incentives and the institutional structure to lay the basis for growth, as well as provide resources that are crucial for achieving macroeconomic stabilisation in Malawi,"" Sudhir Chitale, World Bank task team leader for the project, was quoted as saying. REDUCING TENSIONS AROUND LAND REFORM The rural land development grant would provide access to resources for land acquisition and farm development to poor beneficiary families, and build capacity at the community, district and national levels to implement a community-driven and market-assisted approach to land reform. ""The project will use the already existing financial management mechanisms of the Malawi Social Action Fund, to enable local government structures to empower rural communities to identify beneficiaries and establish new farms on under-utilised lands,"" the Bank said. ""These mechanisms will reduce rural tensions, minimise the incidence of encroachment on either private lands or protected public areas, and encourage productive investments on the newly established farms,"" the Bank's land reform and policy coordinator for Africa, Rogier van den Brink, was quoted as saying. ""This will be the first time in Africa that Bank resources will be used to pay for the purchase of land. The success of this pilot could have important regional implications."" It is estimated that by the end of the project, some 15,000 poor rural families in four pilot districts in the southern part of Malawi would have increased their income. ""The project will also provide secure land titles to the beneficiaries, under the property rights regime they desire,"" the Bank explained. Inadequate access to land has been identified as one of the critical factors contributing to poverty and rural tensions in Malawi. ""The redistribution of unused lands to the poor, and other activities under the project will make a direct contribution to increasing economic growth and reducing poverty,"" the Bank concluded."
"Sanctions will hurt Darfur peace efforts, says gov't","The UN Security Council’s decision to sanction Sudan for failing to end conflict in the western region of Darfur will have a negative effect on current efforts to bring peace and stability to the country, a Sudanese minister said on Wednesday. Mustafa Uthman Isma'il, Sudan’s minister of foreign affairs, was quoted by the official Sudanese news agency, SUNA, as saying that the Council’s latest resolution undermined the capacity of the armed forces, making it difficult ""to ensure the protection of civilians, as well as confronting rebels and militias."" The Council’s resolution, passed on Tuesday, called for assets to be frozen and a travel ban imposed on those believed to be impeding the peace process, or committing human-rights violations in Darfur. The resolution also expanded a previous arms embargo to include the Sudanese government. Stuart Holiday, US representative to the UN, said in a statement following the Council’s decision that he hoped the resolution would contribute to the end of the violence in Darfur, and to the successful conclusion of the Abuja peace talks. Isma'il, however, described the resolution as unbalanced, and said it would have a negative impact on the implementation of the peace agreement in the south, as well as the security situation in Darfur. He further said the resolution would also affect the resumption of peace talks in Abuja, as it would send the wrong message to the rebels. Sudan’s government has since set up a committee to examine the resolution, which includes the foreign, defence, interior, justice and humanitarian affairs ministries, according to Isma’il. This committee will apparently submit to the government its recommendations on how to deal with the Council’s decision. A statement released by the Sudanese foreign ministry on Wednesday said that the government aimed to work in partnership with the international and regional community to lift any sanctions imposed on Sudan. It was considering its moral and legal responsibilities towards its people in all states of the country, and would spare no efforts to make peace a concrete reality, the statement added. SUNA reported that the Sudanese government regretted that the resolution came at a time when the country was working to translate the southern peace agreement into reality. The implementation of the peace agreement, signed on 9 January, would contribute to the resolution of conflicts in other regions of the country. The war in Darfur pits Sudanese government troops, and militias -allegedly allied to the government - against rebels fighting to end what they have called marginalisation and discrimination of the region's inhabitants by the state. Over 2.4 million people continue to be affected by the conflict, 1.85 million of which are internally displaced or have been forced to flee to neighbouring Chad."
World Bank highlights investment challenges,"An assessment of South Africa's investment climate, jointly conducted by the World Bank and department of trade and industry, has revealed that the business environment is favourable in many ways, yet some challenges remain. 'South Africa: an Assessment of the Investment Climate', released on Tuesday, showed that firms were particularly concerned about labour force skills and education, labour regulation, exchange rate instability and crime. ""Although the survey results are by and large very encouraging, there are still a number of issues that have to be addressed,"" Ritva Reinikka, the World Bank country director for South Africa told IRIN. The 2004 survey among more than 800 firms in four main metropolitan areas was undertaken to identify constraints faced by businesses and compare the ""enabling environment"" for enterprise to that of South Africa's competitors. Results indicated that wages for managers, professionals and skilled workers were high by international standards, eroding South Africa's competitiveness; exchange rate volatility made exporting difficult, which was critical to achieving desired high growth rates; and the cost of crime, although lower than in the worst performing middle-income economies, was higher in South Africa than in many competitor countries. ""Addressing these issues will help towards achieving the target growth rate of six percent per annum to stimulate development and job creation,"" Reinikka noted. She observed that ""based on the enterprise survey, South African workers receive less training than in comparative countries - firms pay a levy for training but fewer firms actually provide training"". Tax and finance have usually been major issues in similar surveys, ""but these seem to be less important in South Africa. HIV/AIDS is also an issue that firms seem to be moderately concerned about - a reason might be that in a labour-abundant economy people can be replaced, so this does not register on the bottom line"", she added. Commenting on the survey findings, Bill Lacey, economic affairs officer at the South African Chamber of Business, told IRIN, ""investment in people, in terms of health and education, are a weakness in South Africa; but crime is experienced as a challenge mainly by foreigners, wherever you have poverty, you have crime"". Lacey saw government intervention in the labour market as a major obstacle to investment. ""Although well intentioned and commendable, these interventions end up hurting the workers themselves and, as a result, businesses tend to prefer capital-intensive production over labour-intensive production."" Reinikka also noted that South African enterprise tended to be highly capital intensive. ""But with such a large and relatively low skilled labour force it should be more labour intensive, particularly considering the current high level of unemployment in the country."" Lacey remarked that South Africa's ""arduous regulatory regime"" was another challenge. ""You have to be quite brave to start a business in South Africa - you have to be a labour lawyer, a tax expert and an accountant wrapped into one. This explains the large size of the grey [informal] economy, because people there don't have to worry about regulations."" The full report can be accessed at www.worldbank.org"
World Bank and business groups launch guidelines,"The World Bank and the South African Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS (SABCOHA) launched Guidelines for Building Better Coalitions Against HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa on Thursday. Participants from 15 countries representing business coalitions and national AIDS councils met for a week-long conference to map ways the private sector could unite to fight the epidemic. They plan to establish a regional network with products and services that will serve the interests of business and governments in mounting an effective and sustainable response to HIV/AIDS. In a recent survey, about 41 percent of African firms reported serious current impacts on their business from HIV/AIDS and the majority noted negative effects on operating costs, a World Bank statement said. Brad Mears, chief executive officer of SABCOHA, said the guidelines were the outcome of a long process and aimed at providing the private sector with practical and relevant direction on combining forces to fight the epidemic. According to Elizabeth Ashbourne of the World Bank: ""Coalitions assist companies by facilitating information sharing; permitting economies of scale in the development of workplace HIV/AIDS products and services; and create a strong, unified front for public policy debate and advocacy."""
Security Council demands immediate end to violence,"The UN Security Council adopted a resolution on Friday demanding that the Sudanese government, rebel forces and other armed groups in the western region of Darfur cease all violence and ensure that their members comply with international humanitarian law. Adopting resolution number 1574, the Council - which held a special session on Sudan in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, on Thursday and Friday - endorsed the commitment of the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army Movement/Army (SPLM/A) to reach a final peace agreement on the conflict in the south soon. The SPLM/A and the government had signed a memorandum of understanding on Friday under which they undertook to conclude and sign a final pact to end more than two decades of civil war in southern Sudan not later than 31 December 2004. ""The parties declare their commitment to expeditiously complete negotiation - on ceasefire agreement and implementation modalities, so as to conclude and sign the comprehensive peace agreement no later than 31 December 2004,"" the memorandum said. The Sudanese state minister in the office of the president, Yahya Hussein Babikar, signed the document on behalf of the government, while the SPLM/A main negotiator, Nhial Deng, signed it for the SPLM/A. On Darfur, the Council demanded that the government and all armed groups ""immediately cease all violence and attacks, including abduction - refrain from forcible relocation of civilians, cooperate with international humanitarian relief and monitoring efforts, ensure that their members comply with international humanitarian law, facilitate the safety and security of humanitarian staff, and reinforce throughout their ranks, their agreement to allow unhindered access and passage by humanitarian agencies and those in their employ"". The Council said it would monitor compliance with the resolution ""subject to a further decision of the Council to take appropriate action against any party failing to fulfil its commitments"". It expressed concern over what it said was growing insecurity and violence in Darfur, the dire humanitarian situation there and continuing violations of human rights and repeated breaches of a ceasefire agreement. A comprehensive peace agreement in the south, it noted, would ""contribute towards sustainable peace and stability throughout Sudan, and to efforts to address the crisis in Darfur"". It urged the Joint Assessment Mission of the UN, the World Bank and other aid donors to continue efforts to prepare for the rapid delivery of an aid package for reconstruction and economic development once a final peace deal had been reached and implementation had begun in southern Sudan. The conflict in Darfur pits government troops and militias allied to it against the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equity Movement, who are fighting to end what they have called marginalisation and discrimination of the region by the state. The conflict has displaced an estimated 1.45 million people and sent another 200,000 fleeing across the border into Chad. The war between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government in the south erupted in 1983 when the rebels took up arms against authorities based in the north to demand greater autonomy. In May, they signed six key protocols, covering power-sharing arrangements and the administration of three contested areas during a six-year interim period that will precede a referendum to determine whether the south would remain part of Sudan. Council members started discussing the situation in Somalia on Friday afternoon."
World Bank commits US $ 1 billion to development,"As work began on a new stretch of road that will improve Ghana’s infrastructure links with neighbouring Burkina Faso, World Bank Country Director Mats Karlsson revealed that his institution had committed a further US $ 1 billion to projects, including road building, in Ghana. Karlsson made the announcement at a so-called ‘sod cutting ceremony’ in the Volta Region in eastern Ghana. The ceremony marked the beginning of the construction of another badly needed road to improve north-south access. Road building is essential to Ghana’s economic development, which donors such as the World Bank continue to support. However, it is not happening as fast as most stakeholders would like. The West African nation has about 32,250 kilometres of roads, of which about 12,000 kilometres are main roads yet only around 6,000 kilometres are paved. The remainder are dirt roads, at best graded and levelled by machines. The one billion dollars, said Karlsson, would be available to support health, education, water and other projects, including road building, that would improve socio-economic conditions in the country. The money will be made available over a four-year period. A World Bank employee, who declined to be named, said the funds could be dispersed over more than four years subject to the efficiency of the Ghana government. Government action plans are typically derailed in election years, and with legislative and presidential polls due to be held this coming December, the World Bank’s commitment could well stretch out beyond the planned cut-off date of 2007. Stability dividend Donors’ substantial show of support for the government of Ghana is a reflection of the country’s reputation as a bedrock of stability in a troubled region. Neighbouring Cote d’Ivoire, once the economic success story in West Africa, now flounders in chaos that has gripped the country since a rebellion broke out in September 2002. Though Liberia and Sierra Leone are emerging from protracted civil wars, their bloody conflicts have cast a shadow over the entire region. Gerhard Schroeder, the German Chancellor, is also showing his country’s support for Ghana this week. Schroder is making a four-nation tour of the continent and it is no surprise that Ghana is one of those chosen for a visit. Bilateral and multilateral donors have already sunk billions of dollars into Ghana with a view to spurring its much hoped-for economic takeoff. “The way we see Ghana,” says Jan Randolph Chief Economist at World Markets Research Centre, a London-based business intelligence group, “is that the World Bank and IMF have staked their reputation on making a success of Ghana.” “The donors have had a lot more leeway in policy-making matters in Ghana than in any other African country”, said Randolph. “As a result, they have put their reputation on the line. If Ghana fails then it throws a question mark over donor policy throughout Africa.” Indeed, results on paper look encouraging. According to the IMF, GDP growth has been consistently around the 4-percent mark each year for the last 10 years, while inflation has remained in single digits. Yet despite the donors’ millions, the IMF estimates that average income per capita in Ghana will be US $ 385 this year, almost half that of Senegal, also considered a bastion of democracy in West Africa. Poor roads hinder development According to John Mahama, member of parliament for the Bole/ Bamboi Constituency in north-eastern Ghana, road building is a “critical” element in speeding up Ghana’s progress. There is no tarred road linking Bole/ Bamboi with the south of the country. In fact, the road is so bad that the State Transport Company, which runs the national bus service, last week threatened to end its service to Bole unless something was done about the potholed dirt roads. Mahama said the threat was a real one, and would leave his constituents stranded. The bus company had withdrawn their service before, “many years ago,” he said, “and for exactly the same reason.” Mahama complained that the poor state of the nation’s roads was impinging on the potential for economic development in his constituency. Though Bole/Bamboi is one of the most fertile regions in Ghana, farmers struggle to get their produce, yams, cassava and shea nut, south to market. Similarly, all the region’s petroleum needs have to be supplied via tankers that laboriously crawl along the bumpy tracks. In the rainy season, whole sections of the road become impassable to all but the best of four by fours, or the most fearless of drivers. Until the entire country is accessible trade and development will be hindered. But progress is slow, and existing road development projects in the Bole/Bamboi area are falling behind schedule, said Mahama. As for the national economy, Randolph believes the World Bank and IMF will do whatever it takes to make sure Ghana continues to produce promising results on paper. “Ghana is like a deflated balloon with lots of holes in it” said Randolph. “Donors will continue to put money in it and yes, the balloon will go up, but not for very long.”"
"Security Council meeting to focus on Sudan, Somalia","The United Nations Security Council meeting that is due to take place on Thursday and Friday in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, will focus on the situation in Sudan and on the peace process in Somalia,a UN official said. Jean-Victor Nkolo, the media advisor to the Secretariat for the Security Council meeting in Nairobi, told IRIN on Tuesday that the session would discuss the crisis in the Darfur region of western Sudan and the long-running conflict in the south. ""Somalia will also be discussed,"" Nkolo added. A Council statement issued earlier said the meeting would also be attended by representatives of the African Union, which is trying to broker a peace deal between Khartoum and insurgents fighting the Sudanese government in Darfur. Other officials in attendance will represent the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development - a grouping of east Africa states spearheading peace talks between the Sudanese government and the south-based rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army. The Nairobi meeting will mark the 11th time in the history of the Council that it has met away from UN Headquarters in New York. Previously, it has met in London, Paris (twice), Geneva, Addis Ababa and Panama City, as well as several venues in New York State, other than the UN headquarters. The representatives of the 15 members of Council are expected to travel to Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda after the Nairobi meeting, from 20 to 25 November, the UN reported on Monday. ""We're going to say that the international community is there to help,"" French Ambassador Jean-Marc de la Sablière told a news conference in New York. The Council, he added, would encourage the four African States to foster dialogue and cooperation with each other. ""There has to be in this region, among all the countries, a confidence which has been lacking in the past,"" UN News quoted him as saying. While the UN was there to help, he added, it ""cannot replace the parties; it is up to the parties involved to achieve reconciliation and dialogue."""
Security Council to meet over Darfur report,"The UN Security Council will not allow perpetrators of atrocities against civilians in the western Sudanese region of Darfur to go unpunished, according to the Council’s president. The Council will address the situation in some ""internationally recognised way"", Joel W. Adechi, permanent representative of Benin and Council president for February, told reporters on Wednesday. Adechi was responding to the recently released report of a UN-appointed commission of inquiry into whether or not genocide occurred in Darfur. The commission concluded on Monday that violence in Darfur did not amount to genocide, but that mass killings of civilians had occurred in the strife-torn area. ""The crucial element of genocidal intent appears to be missing, at least as far as the central government authorities are concerned,"" the five-member commission said. ""There may have been genocidal acts in Darfur and some individuals may be found guilty of genocidal intent."" The commission identified suspected perpetrators of atrocities, including government officials, rebels, and ""foreign army officers acting in their personal capacity"", in an annex to the report, opening the door for their prosecution as war criminals. While welcoming the work of the commission, US State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said on Tuesday that the US stood by its own conclusion, reached in September 2004, that genocide had occurred in Darfur. ""We think that the continued accumulation of facts on the ground, the facts that are reported here in the commission's report, support that view, that conclusion that we reached and continue to hold,"" Boucher said in a statement. The UN commission recommended that the Council refer its dossier on the crimes in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC), but Boucher said the US believed that the best way to address the crimes, detailed in the report, was to establish an ad-hoc UN and African Union tribunal. ""We think it's important for the Security Council to consider the various options, and we believe that having accountability for these crimes in a tribunal that is based in Arusha, Tanzania, is the best way to ensure accountability,"" he added. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said Britain preferred the new Hague-based ICC, but stressed that the key issue was consensus in the Security Council. Regarding the African position on the ICC and sanctions, Adechi said the issue had not yet been discussed, but the Council would discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission. ""I think my own position on the ICC is quite well-known to you. It's a Court I support,"" Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, told reporters on Wednesday. ""The Commission recommends a referral to the ICC,"" Annan noted, adding that he hoped the Council would ""come to an understanding and take the essential action to prosecute those responsible"". ""They must be prosecuted, whichever way the Council decides to go,"" Annan said. Adechi announced that in February, the Council would hold at least two meetings, and possibly a third, on Sudan. The meetings would focus on both the situation in Darfur - where violent clashes have been reported this week - and the proposal for the establishment of a UN peace-support mission in southern Sudan following the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement on 9 January. ""It is too early to say what type of resolution can be expected,"" Adechi said, noting that all Council members looked at the Sudan in a comprehensive way, and that it was impossible to consider a peacekeeping force for the north-south agreement without taking into account the humanitarian situation in Darfur. The war in Darfur pits the Sudanese government troops and militias, allegedly allied to the government, against rebels fighting to end what they have called the state's marginalisation of and discrimination against the region's inhabitants. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Darfur and as many as 1.85 million people are internally displaced or have fled to neighbouring Chad. The UN has described the Darfur conflict as one of the world's worst humanitarian crises."
"Normalise relations, Security Council urges","The UN Security Council has urged Ethiopia and Eritrea to normalise their relations, saying it was encouraged by the recent move towards a peaceful resolution of their border dispute. The Council, in a statement issued by its president for December and ambassador of Algeria, Abdallah Baali, commended both Ethiopia's recent announcement that it had a new peace plan and Eritrea's continued acceptance of an independent boundary commission's decision on the frontier as binding. ""Members of the Security Council are encouraged by this movement towards a peaceful solution of the border dispute and now look forward to the beginning of the border demarcation process,"" the Council said. It urged the two neighbours to ""refrain from any action in the border area, which could be viewed as provocative or destabilising"". Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi warned Eritrea last week that attempts to turn tough words into military action would ""endanger the peace of the region"". His comments followed demands by Eritrea that Ethiopia withdraws from territory along the 1,000-km border, which it says Addis Ababa had illegally occupied. Tensions also rose when Asmara accused Addis Ababa of sending troops into a remote Eritrean village in November. Ethiopia denied the accusations and UN peacekeepers patrolling the region said they had found no evidence to support the accusation. Last month, Ethiopia accepted ""in principle"" a ruling on the border that was made as a part of a peace deal, which ended the two-and-a-half year war. The ruling on the border was made in April 2002 by an internationally-appointed commission. It was initially rejected by Ethiopia, which still insists that the decision by the commission to award Badme - the border town where the war flared up in 1998 - to Eritrea, was wrong. Eritrea has reiterated that Ethiopia must abide by the ruling, saying the dispute could be resolved if Addis Ababa withdrew ""its forces from sovereign Eritrean territories"". It said the border stalemate had dislocated 60,000 people from their homes and villages and created ""clouds of another unnecessary and unjustifiable confrontation""."
World Bank provides $12.5m to fight locusts,"The World Bank has offered US$12.5 million of fast disbursing funds to help fight the locust invasion of West Africa and has accused both governments in the region and donors of being slow to realise the full scale of the crisis. The United States has meanwhile officially classified the locust invasion of northern and central Senegal as a ""disaster,"" opening the way for Washington to provide further aid to the country. And over the weekend, the United Nations warned that severe damage to crops and pasture in several countries could lead to ""localised famine situations"" and a requirement for food aid. Reuters quoted James Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, as telling journalists in Washington on Friday: ""I personally think we should have been more aggressive on locusts and the world should have been, but I think African leaders should have too."" Speaking hours after the World Bank announced an emergency aid package for seven West African countries affected by locusts, Wolfensohn said there was enough money currently available to deal with the problem. The essential thing now, he stressed, was to deliver effective help quickly. The locust invasion is the worst to hit West Africa for 15 years. Agricultural experts from the region estimated earlier this month that the insects could destroy up to 25 percent of this year's grain harvest across the Sahel. The World Bank said in a statement that its new Africa Emergency Locust Project would offer soft loans to Mauritania, Mali, Senegal, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, the seven countries where harvests are most at risk. The bank said it would also provide longer term help to raise agricultural productivity in West Africa, improve food security and put in place a new early warning system. The US embassy in Senegal said on Friday that ambassador Richard Roth had officially classified this year's locust invasion of the country as a ""disaster."" This would allow the State Department to mobilise additional resources to fight the insects, it added, noting that Roger Winter, a senior USAID official, was currently on a 10-day tour of West Africa to assess the locust situation. The United States has so far given US$3.6 million to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to boost locust control efforts in West Africa. The FAO estimated earlier this month that it would cost US$100 million to bring the locust situation under control. Limited treatment The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) noted in its latest report on the locust situation, issued over the weekend that to date less than 16 percent of the estimated 3.5 million hectares infested with locusts in West Africa, had been treated with insecticide. It cited Senegal as having done the most effective job so far, despite severe crop losses in isolated pockets. The authorities had managed to spray nearly two thirds of the 307,000 hectares of land thought to be infected with locusts, OCHA said. However, locust swarms move easily from country to country and Keith Cressman, a locust control officer with FAO in Rome, pointed out last week that Senegal was in grave danger of being invaded by new swarms of insects bred in neighbouring Mauritania and Mali where control measures have been much less successful. OCHA said arid Mauritania had managed to treat less than nine percent of its land area invaded by locusts and stood to lose up to 40 percent of its crops and pasture to the insects. Mali, which has only managed to treat 20 percent of its locust-infested land was officially forecasting that it would lose about 440,000 tonnes of its grain harvest, OCHA said. However UN officials told IRIN last week that the Agriculture Ministry in Bamako was privately anticipating much heavier crop damage of around one million tonnes - about a third of this year's expected harvest. Senegal's main crop-growing areas in the south and centre of the country have so far escaped locust damage. But Cressman at the FAO warned that could change in the coming weeks if swarms blown west from Mauritania and Mali to the Atlantic coast were then blown southwards by the prevailing winds, just as the harvest gets under way. OCHA said: ""Severe damage to both agricultural and pastoral land has been registered in some countries and could, if the situation deteriorates further, result in localise famine situations. As a consequence, food aid could be needed for the affected populations, especial agricultural farmers and pastoral nomads."" OCHA is organising a meeting of donor countries to West Africa in Dakar on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the humanitarian situation in the region in general and the possible consequences of the locust crisis in particular."
Security Council members set for Nairobi meeting,"Members of the United Nations Security Council were due to begin a two-day meeting in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, on Thursday morning to discuss conflict resolution in Sudan and the peace process in Somalia, UN sources said. Jean-Victor Nkolo, media advisor to the secretariat for the Council meeting in Nairobi, told IRIN on Tuesday that the session would discuss the crisis in the Darfur region of western Sudan, the long-running conflict in the south and the situation in Somalia. Council members arrived in Kenya on Wednesday, UN News service reported. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, travelled to Nairobi and was scheduled to address the Council session on Thursday, it added. Annan's Special Representative for the Sudan Jan Pronk, the Sudanese Vice President Ali Uthman Taha and the leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), John Garang, also arrived in Nairobi ahead of the meeting. The Council consists of five permanent members - Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. The other non-permanent members are currently Algeria, Angola, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Pakistan, Philippines, Romania and Spain. A delegation from the African Union (AU) would hold consultations with the Council on how to strengthen cooperation between the two organisations, a statement from the AU said. The AU is trying to broker a peace deal between Khartoum and insurgents fighting the Sudanese government in the western region of Darfur. The meeting was also to be attended by representatives of the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which is spearheading peace talks between Khartoum and the SPLM/A. IGAD also facilitated a two-year Somali reconciliation conference in Nairobi that culminated in the formation of a parliament and the election of a president for the strife-torn country last month. Several African heads of state were expected in Nairobi for the Council meeting, including the current chairman of IGAD, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and the AU Chairman and Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki would also attend. The 15 members of the Council are expected to travel to Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda after the Nairobi meeting, from 20 to 25 November. The decision to meet in Nairobi was made last month. The US Ambassador to the UN, John Danforth, will chair the Council meeting in Nairobi. Ahead of the meeting, human rights groups urged the Council to hold those responsible for atrocities in the Sudan accountable. ""The impunity enjoyed by the Sudanese authorities in their ongoing atrocities in Darfur demonstrates why the near-final peace deal to end the country’s North-South conflict must include accountability for human rights abuses,"" Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement issued on Thursday. ""Unless they are held accountable for abuses in the south, the Sudanese authorities will continue to believe they can get away with murder in Darfur,"" Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher for HRW said in the statement. ""There’s still time for Security Council members meeting in Nairobi to insist that the final peace agreement includes accountability for past abuses and protections against future ones."" HRW called for the prosecution of those implicated in grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Sudan and the creation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to ensure full disclosure of human rights abuses in the armed conflicts that have ravaged Sudan since 1983. It urged international mediators to insist that both the government and rebels be held accountable for past abuses, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. On Tuesday, Amnesty International (AI), in a report titled: ""Sudan: Arming the perpetrators of grave abuses in Darfur"", accused foreign governments of allowing the supply of various types of arms into Sudan. ""Foreign governments have enabled the government of Sudan to arm and deploy untrained and unaccountable militias that have deliberately and indiscriminately killed civilians in Darfur on a large scale - destroying homes, looting property and forcibly displacing the population,"" AI said. ""The tragedy of Darfur is that the international community, already heavily engaged in the North-South peace process in Sudan, took far too long to recognise the state-sponsored pattern of violence and displacement and failed to act earlier to protect the population,"" it added. The report gives details of attacks against civilians by government-allied militias in Darfur. ""Now, over a large area of Darfur, villages are destroyed or emptied of their population - the people driven out have swollen the numbers in towns or gathered in camps for displaced persons. Some have fled to Chad, Khartoum or elsewhere inside or out of Sudan,"" it noted. ""Amnesty International specifically requests member states of the Security Council to impose a mandatory arms embargo on Sudan to stop those supplies [from] reaching the parties to the conflict in Darfur, including the government forces, until effective safeguards are in place to protect civilians from grave human rights abuses,"" AI said. The conflict in Darfur pits Sudanese government troops and militias allied to it against the Sudanese Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and the Justice and Equity Movement (JEM), which are fighting to end what they have called marginalisation and discrimination of the region by the state. The conflict has displaced an estimated 1.45 million people and sent another 200,000 fleeing across the border into Chad. Talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, between the Sudanese government and the rebels reached a deadlock early this month over a proposal to create a no-fly zone in the troubled area. The SLM/A and JEM, which have fought the government for the past 20 months, had agreed to sign the document, Khartoum did not. The AU’s chief mediator, Allam-Mi Ahmad, said on 6 November that the talks were on the brink of failure. ""We have done everything possible trying to reconcile the different positions,"" Ahmad said. Two previous rounds of talks between the participants failed to yield an agreement. On Wednesday, the UN Advance Mission in Sudan (UNAMIS) reported that internally displaced people had accused the police of firing indiscriminately at Kalma camp in South Darfur over the weekend. The government, UNAMIS said, reported that rebels within the camp had fired on police positions, forcing an exchange of gunfire. UNAMIS also reported that residents in camps around El-Geneina were increasingly concerned about the presence of armed men in and around their camps. They said that gunshots were being fired during the night. The conflict between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government in the south erupted in 1983 when the rebels in the mainly Christian and animist region took up arms against authorities based in the Muslim, largely Arabised north to demand greater autonomy for their region. In May, both sides signed six key protocols during talks in Naivasha, Kenya, covering power-sharing arrangements and the administration of three contested areas during a six-year interim period that will precede a referendum to determine whether the south would remain part of Sudan. The Nairobi meeting is the fourth time that the Council has met away from UN headquarters in New York, and its first formal meeting in the Kenyan capital. The UN Information Centre in Nairobi has accredited more than 400 national and international reporters to cover the event."
Annan asks Security Council to visit region,"UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday asked the UN Security Council to visit Ethiopia and Eritrea to help the Horn of Africa neighbours overcome their simmering border dispute. ""The on-going stalemate in the peace process is not sustainable in the long term,"" Annan said in a report on the tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea. ""I would like therefore to renew my recommendation to the Security Council to undertake a mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea in order to reassure the two countries of the Council's unflinching commitment to the peace process,"" he added. Eritrea became independent from Ethiopia in 1993 after a referendum, but a war over their 1,000-km-long frontier broke out in 1998. The conflict ended after the two nations signed a peace deal in Algiers, Algeria, in December 2000, but tension has remained. Annan also expressed concern over recent shootings in the demilitarised temporary security zone, a 25-km-wide corridor patrolled by UN peacekeepers to keep both armies apart. ""Such incidents could easily escalate into incidents that would compromise military stability and roll back the peace process,"" he cautioned. Under the Algiers accord, both governments agreed that the Ethiopia-Eritrea Boundary Commission would draw up and physically mark out their frontier. The new internationally recognised border was due to be completed in October 2003. Ethiopia refused to accept the commission’s ruling, however, saying it could lead to renewed conflict, and called for dialogue with Asmara. Eritrea maintained that the border must be constructed before any talks could take place. In December, Ethiopia began deploying thousands of soldiers to the border region, in what it said was a purely defensive measure. Annan reiterated his call for the troops to be pulled back from the border. In his report, Annan said, ""The attainment of durable peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea rests primarily with the two countries. Fulfillment of this responsibility is a debt that the parties owe to their peoples."""
Security Council concerned over Darfur,"The UN Security Council expressed deep concern on Tuesday over the recent escalation of violence in the western Sudanese region of Darfur and called on all parties to the conflict to stop renewed clashes. ""The members call on all parties to cease all acts of violence and implement provisions of Security Council resolutions,"" the Council President for December, Algerian Ambassador Abdallah Baali, said in a press statement. The call followed a briefing by the UN under-secretary-general for political affairs, Kieran Prendergast, who said the humanitarian situation in Darfur was ""dire"". He said the number of people affected by the conflict had risen to almost 2.3 million – more than a third of the total population since the November. Prendergast said November had been characterised by violence and a marked deterioration in the security situation. The percentage of vulnerable people who could be reached, for example, fell from about 90 to 80 percent due to increased insecurity and the onset of the rainy season. In North Darfur, where tens of thousands were cut off from relief aid, the percentage fell to 67 percent. ""The SLA [the rebel Sudan Liberation Army] is thought to be responsible for instigating much of the violence, although it has denied this,"" Prendergast said. Aerial bombings by the government in retaliation, if confirmed, would also be in breach of the humanitarian and security protocols signed by all warring parties in Abuja, Nigeria, on 9 November, Prendergast noted. He added that the Sudanese foreign ministry had continued to deny the reports of aerial bombings, despite the African Union (AU) saying it had evidence to that effect. He said increased activity by Janjawid and other pro-government militias threatened to plunge Darfur into chaos. ""The militias have become a destabilising factor, posing a dilemma for existing mechanisms intended to deal with ceasefire violations,"" Prendergast said. ""They are not included in any of the political negotiations, nor are they signatories to the ceasefire agreement. ""The international community must send an unequivocal message to all Sudanese parties that violence and hostile military actions are not an acceptable means to achieve political gains,"" he added. ""Regrettably, the government has made no progress in disarming the Janjawid."" Prendergast added that the AU Ceasefire Commission had confirmed it had not been invited, so far, to verify any disarmament activities by the government. He praised the efforts of the AU and called upon the international community to provide all the necessary support to enable the AU to increase its capacity in Darfur; so far consisting of only 800 troops and just over 100 military observers for its monitoring and mediating tasks. The war in Darfur is between Sudanese government troops and militias allegedly allied to the government, and rebels fighting to end what they have called marginalisation and discrimination of the region's inhabitants by the state. The conflict has displaced an estimated 1.45 million people and sent another 200,000 fleeing across the border into Chad."
World Bank boosts conservation and ecotourism initiatives,"The World Bank has approved a US $10 million credit for the conservation of Mozambique's biodiversity and natural ecosystems through the promotion of sustainable use and the development of natural resources by local communities. The Trans-frontier Conservation Area and Tourism Development Project, for which the bank approved the credit, represents the second phase of a 15-year initiative known as the Trans-frontier Conservation Areas (TFCA) programme, the long-term objectives of which are to conserve biodiversity in the southern Africa region and emphasise regional collaboration in the management of trans-frontier resources. A World Bank press release on Thursday said the funds would be used to establish and manage conservation in three areas on the Mozambican border with significant trans-border biodiversity linkages with neighbouring countries. ""The project will increase revenues for communities, from the growth in environmentally sustainable tourism in the three Trans-frontier Conservation Areas of Chimanimani, Lubombo and Greater Limpopo,"" said Jean-Michel Pavy, the World Bank task team leader of the project. Public sector and local community capacity would be strengthened to manage biodiversity and natural resources, while the private sector is to be engaged through the promotion of ecotourism. ""It will also support the government's efforts in improving the business environment, with a view to stimulating private sector investments and private sector-led economic growth,"" said Pavy. Management of the initiative will be entrusted to the National Directorate for Conservation Areas. Environmentally sustainable tourism development links the conservation and development objectives of the TFCAs by providing an economic alternative to unsustainable, destructive use of natural resources, as well as a direct economic incentive to maintain the natural ecosystems and their biodiversity. Further financing for the project will come from a $10 million grant by the Global Environment Facility and a $3.7 million grant from the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development Fund. The credit will be provided on International Development Association (IDA) terms. The IDA is part of the World Bank, and helps the poorest of developing countries by providing interest-free loans and grants for programmes aimed at boosting economic growth and improving living conditions."
African Union inaugurates its Security Council,"The African Union (AU) on Tuesday inaugurated its Peace and Security Council (PSC), hailing it as a manifestation of Africa's determination to end conflicts and wars that have been witnessed across the continent for decades. ""The decisions expected of the PSC must be strictly implemented by all the states concerned,"" Mozambique's president and the AU Chairman, Joaquim Chissano, said in a speech during the launch at the AU headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. ""The Peace and Security Council has been designed to be a strong signal to the African peoples and the international community of our determination to put an end to the conflicts and wars which have ravaged the continent for far too long,"" he added. The PSC, which is modelled on the UN Security Council, was established to promote peace, security and stability in Africa, and to create conditions conducive to sustainable development in the world's poorest continent. It has 15 members mandated to send fact-finding missions to conflict areas where ceasefire accords have been signed and to recommend to the assembly of AU heads of state that troops be deployed in cases of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. ""It is important that pragmatic solutions be considered to make it possible to mobilise, in less than a week, the observers and troops whom we may need each time when the need arises,"" said Chissano. He called upon the AU to support the Sudanese government and rebels fighting it in the western Darfur region to find a lasting solution to the conflict there, and to help in the ongoing humanitarian operation supporting those displaced by the strife. ""We need to know the truth about what is happening in this region of the Sudan. We need urgent, exceptional activities, more than what we have done so far,"" said Chissano. ""In Darfur as well as in north of Uganda, Africa must help Africa, be it [even just] a little. Africa is generally absent today in the ongoing humanitarian support,"" he added."
